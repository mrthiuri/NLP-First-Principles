    "The evolution of human civilisation in any field, whether in technology, agriculture, finance or any other field, rests on two essential pillars:\n",
    "> - Continuity of innovation\n",
    "> - Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Any advancements we make stem either from standing on the shoulders of giants or collborating with others to turn ideas into reality. The vehicle for transferring knowledge between generations is language. It preserves discoveries, ideas and methods for other to build upon.\n",
    "This foundational idea of language — a way to communicate — permeates every aspect of our lives.\n",
    "Consider programming languages, a revolutionary approach that allows humans to give instructions to machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basic idea of language, ***a way to communicate*** , has permeated to the very fabric of the world we live in. Cosnider programming languages, a revolutionary approach that allows humans to give instructions to machines. \n",
    "What is a scroll?\n",
    "What are video games?\n",
    "What happens when you click a mouse and a file opens?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of these interactions, we are communicating with machines, either graphically through interfaces or directly through code. These interfaces act as a bridge between human intentions and machine capabilities — breaking down our instructions into 1's and 0's.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet this brings forth a crucial question:\n",
    "\n",
    "We must have all interacted with some form of technology whether a personal computer or a phone. What is a scroll? What are video games? What is 'WhatsApp'? How does clicking a mouse translate to say, opening a file?. How do simple actions like these translate to actions? At the heart of these interactions, we are interacting with a machine, either graphically through interfaces or directly through code. These interfaces act as a bridge between user objectives and hardware capabilities, breaking down our instructions into 1's and 0's.  Yet this brings forth some crucial questions:\n",
    "> **How do we make machines understand human language?**\n",
    "> **wait..., don't they?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, this is one of the most fascinating and difficult frontiers in modern computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🧐 Why is Natural Language Processing a challenge?**\n",
    "Human language is rich, dynamic and layered with complexities that are deeply intuitive for humans but difficult for machines to grasp. Some of the key challenges include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Ambiguties**\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, language is nothing if not complicated. Three striking ambiguities emerge:\n",
    "> **1. Lexical ambiguity:** when a word has more than one possible meaning and the meaning has to be inferred from the context in which the word is used. For example;\n",
    "- ***She went to get gold from the bank***. Which bank?  A river bank, or an actual bank?\n",
    "> **2. Syntactical ambiguity:** when a phrase has more than one potnetial meaning. For example:\n",
    "- ***Visiting relatives can be annoying***\n",
    "> **3. Referential ambiguity:** occurs when we use pronouns. For example:\n",
    "- ***It was she who started the confrontation with him***. Who do we refer to as him? Who is she?\n",
    "\n",
    "These ambiguities make writing down deterministic algorithms for language very difficult. Equally, the level of accuracy required in any language tasks cannot simply be achieved by taking a heuristic approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Dynamic nature**\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is ever evolving, with new additions to the vocabulary, inflected forms, flexible boundaries that allow the introdcution of words from other languages to another language. \n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Nuances**\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is characterised by nuances such as slang, irony, sacarsm that are learned through use of the language and perceived from context. This additional layer of complexity further contributes to an already daunting task of making computers understand human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **📜 A Brief History: From Computational Linguistics to NLP**\n",
    "The most instrumental breakthroughs in technology, from the microchip to the internet, emerged from research. As you would imagine, making computers understand human language has always been an attractive prospect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the late 1970s, the Cold War arms race fueled a need to translate Russian scientific journals into English. This effort gave rise to **Computational linguistics**, an interdisciplinary field blending language and computing. Over time, computational linguistics evolved into what we now call **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**. NLP is simply a well structured journey to making computers understand and ultimately generate human language, pushing the frontier of human machine interaction. The computer can understand your every day language and it can also present information in your every day language. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🌍 What is Natural Language Processing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**NLP** is a sub-field of computer science that focuses on interpreting, understanding and generating human language. \n",
    "\n",
    "We broadly divide NLP into two main branches:\n",
    "1. **Natural Language Understanding(NLU)**: involves interpreting and understanding the meaning and strutcure of language.\n",
    "2. **Naural Language Generatrion(NLG)**: invovles computers prodcuing human-like text.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Interestingly, while NLG can generate random sentences from a word list, meaningful generation relies heavily on a deep understanding of language, making NLU foundational to modern NLP systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **🤷🏾‍♂️ Why should we care about NLP?**\n",
    "We use solutions pegged on NLP in our everyday lives:\n",
    "- ChatGPT and AI assistants\n",
    "- Spam detectors on Gmail\n",
    "- Autocomplete on phone keyboards\n",
    "- Voice assitants like Siri and Alexa\n",
    "- Customer service chatbots\n",
    "- Lamguage Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern applications like ChatGPT showcase NLP’s power to decode language, infer meaning, and generate coherent, context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this breakdown of NLP, we focus on approaches used to facilitate the mindblowing innovations in the realm of natural language processing"

    "### **⏳ From Rule Based NLP to Modern NLP**\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is largely unstructured which makes NLP that much more difficult. Attempting to programatically break down language in one way or another is not new to us. From early simple chatbots like `ELISA` to language translation in the late 80's and 90's. But if its been done before, why are chatbots only seemingly entering the scene now? Well chatbots have been around for decades but never this accurate or quite frankly this good. Which brings the point home on why NLP is so powerful and advanced today. The main difference between NLP in the 80's and NLP today is the technology behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early NLP:** applied heuristics(rule-based) approaches to text data. This works but does not scale well. You simply cannot hard code all the rules of grammar, dependencies and different uses of words in a single algorithm. And even if you did, imagine doing this for multiple languages. To make matters worse, think of how dynamic language is, how would you begin to capture everything from the building blocks of words to the complexity of entire sentences? These limitations however did not limit advancements. It was well agreed on that rule-based NLP was simply too simple to capture all the complexities of language and there was need for a better apporach to working with text. Necessity is indeed the mother of invention and this led to statistical approaches to NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**😁 Fun Demo:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out my simple rule-based chatbot for a hair products store:\n",
    "\n",
    "‼️👉🏾: [Rule-Based Chatbot](https://tshair.streamlit.app/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical methods:** in the early 2000s, there was a shift to a statistical approach to NLP where words,text and documents were converted to numerical representations. Now all the advancements in NLP technology from ***Large Language Models(LLMs)***,***Bag of Words***,***Word2Vec*** and now recently ***Transformers*** are simply variations of how we convert text to numerical representations with each improvement capturing the complexity of language more accurately. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and shortcomings. However, one thing is for sure, the shift to statistical learning was a game changer."

    "#### **🔧 Stripping text to its building blocks**\n",
    "We have already established that while computers excel at working with numbers, they struggle with understanding natural language in its raw form. We therefore need to come up with approaches to representing words, phrases and entire sentences numerically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goals are:\n",
    "- **Natural Language Understanding:** encoding the meaning and structure of language in a form a machine can interpet.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Generation:** enabling computers to produce human-like text, as seen in chatbots and AI assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how exactly do we do this?\n",
    "Should we: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Assign each word in the english vocabulary a number and match its occurrence in a text to that number so that any text becomes a string of numbers?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    👉🏾 **Example:** *\"Natural Language Processing is fun\"*  -> `1 17 2 3 7`\n",
    "- Represent each word as a vector of numbers instead of a single number? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    👉🏾 **Example:** *\"Language\"* -> `[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If so, how long should that vector be?\n",
    "- Simply capture the presence of a word in a sentence? \n",
    "    \n",
    "    👉🏾 Does that capture enough about meaning and context?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whichever way you choose to look at it, we have to maintain the structure that is engrained in language itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Letters → Words → Phrases → Sentences → Paragraphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "The big question is - **How far down should we strip language** before converting it to numeric format? Should we work at the letter level, word level or with entire phrases?\n",

    "📌📝 **Important Note:**  \n",
    "While this illustration simplifies the concept, real-world Natural Language Processing involves a few more essential steps before a computer can meaningfully work with text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically:\n",
    "- We **preprocess the text** to clean and standardize it.  \n",
    "  👉🏾 This involves techniques like **stemming** and **lemmatization** to reduce words like *understands*, *understand* and *understood* to a common base form (e.g., ***understand***).  \n",
    "  👉🏾 Other steps often include **removing punctuation**, **lowercasing**, **removing stopwords** and **tokenizing** the text into individual words or subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After preprocessing, we use **algorithms and models** to represent and understand the text.  \n",
    "  👉🏾 For example, we might use **Bag of Words**, **word embeddings** (like Word2Vec) or **transformer-based models** (like BERT) that can capture the meaning and context of words based on how they’re used in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Key takeaway:**  \n",

    "Language has a lot of components that do not necessarily contribute to the meaning of a word or sentence but play a crucial role in the structure of a sentence or phrase. In NLP, these components are not part of the core components of a language that we need the computer to learn. We therefore, either mutate or remove these components all together. From contracted forms to verbs such as understanding, our main goal is to break down language to components that will allow us to capture and encode the meaning of those components. Let's consider the noun understand, well other forms of the word are understood and understanding. The Oxford dictionary for instance is cited to have about 600,000 words. Now imagine how many different word forms we can have for all those words. This is why in NLP, we device approaches to break down words into their simplest forms known as `lemmas` or alternatively `stems` which gives birth to the two approaches we can use to break down words:  `Stemming` and `Lemmatization`. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Stemming*** is a technique that cuts off prefixes and suffixes from a word to reduce it to a simpler form. However, the result may not always be an actual word. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Lemmatization***, on the other hand, reduces a word to its base or dictionary form (called a lemma) by following a set of rules and checking against a real vocabulary. Therefore, lemmatization always results in actual words. \n",

    "`Encoding` is the process of converting data into a different format to make it suitable for storage, transmission or processing. For NLP, we encode text data to make it suitable for processing by a computer. In this section, we focus on approaches that we can use to perform **encoding**. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the million dollar question is, **How should we encode text?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will walk down memory lane and by the end, the whole idea of why computers only understand numbers and the need for encoding in NLP will be clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of computers is the need to perform a computation, whether as simple as addition or subtraction. Computers perform this kinds of operations by utilisng a series of logic where any operation or input can be achieved or represented as a series of 1's and 0's. In the early years of computers, the only thing that was fed into a computer was this series of 1's and 0's and the output was again a series of 1's and 0's and it was someone's job to then convert this binary sequence to \"human-readable form\". You and I might think of this as possibly the worst time to exist but at the time, it was revolutionary. The interaction where you have a sequence of binary as input to a computer and a sequence of binary as output has remained the same, computers have and still work with this series of 0's and 1's. What has changed over time is how we feed in commands and data,what we call an interface. You don't need to feed a series of 1's and 0's you can simply type in something. However, the computer hardware and mechanisms have not changed, all input to the processing unit still needs to be in binary, so whatever you type as a command still needs to be converted to binary. This was the brith of encoding, simply to convert user input to binary notation and output to something readable. We keep saying binary is not readable🤷🏾‍♂️?\n",
    "\n",
    "👉🏾 **Example:** The word \"hello\" in binary is `1001000 1100101 1101100 1101100 1101111`. You might begin to see how this can be a headache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers have always been complicated pieces of machinery and even back then, no individual really built their computer from scratch. The development of computers was left to manufacturers and each manufacturer needed a way to convert user input which is text to binary and binary back to a human readable form. A rule based sytem for matching. At some point each manufacturer had their own approach. However, in the 60s, ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was introduced was introduced which was a way to standardise encoding of text to a format computers can understand. \n",
    "    👉🏾 Text like \"NLP is fun\" converted to binary notation in ASCII is `01001110 01001100 01010000 00100000 01101001 01110011 00100000 01100110 01110101 01101110`\n",

    "Great, now you have multiple people using these amazing machines. However, to communicate something you came up with on your computer, you have to print it and send it to the other person, another person who also has a computer. Why not simply send it through the computers? This question and need for a change in communication sparks yet another revolutionary innovation, **the internet**. 6 years after the inception of ASCII, the internet broke into the scene. Now, someone in Japan could effectively share information with someone in the United States over the internet. At least conceptually, there was a problem. ASCII only supported the encoding of the English language only. Other countries with had differnet encoding systems for their language, Japan had their own, Russia had their own. Similar to computer, transmission of information on the internet takes place in the same sequence of 1's and 0's so it was important to have a unified standard of converting text, numbers, special chatacters, symbols and now even emojis to this format. This led to the birth of the **[Unicode Consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium)**. Someone else was now incharge of specifiying the rules of how ext is represented for each language.\n",

    "##### **🤔 From Text to Numbers: Why We Use Vectors**\n",
    "For most advancements in technology, we have stood on the shoulders of giants, building on top of what already exists especially when it comes to computers. So if we already have a way to encode text, **why do we need to do it differently for NLP?**\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP looks to do more than simply allow a computer to process text. Its about making a computer actually understand the language. The path to achieving this has necessitated the development of approaches, tools and algorithms that vary significantly from what existed. One such approach is the use of vectors to represent text.In NLP we need numerical representations of text that let us ask:\n",
    "- Is bank in this sentence a financial institution or a riverbank?\n",
    "- Does light here mean ‘not heavy’ or ‘illuminate’?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP focuses on understanding, interpreting and generating text. One would argue that encoding fornats that allow computers to \"understand\" text contribute to **Natural Language Understanding**. \n",
    "\n",
    "But is this actual Natural Language Understanding? We simply structure the representation of characters into a numeric format for transmission or storage. Transmission when we send messages back and forth with freinds and loved ones and storage in files such as pdf's. All we have is a way to represent each character in a language in a format a computer friendly format. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple word like 'language' becomes `1101100 1100001 1101110 1100111 1110101 1100001 1100111 1100101`. The way I see it, we are beginning to get some answers to our questions earlier on. Breaking down language to the letters might be too far down, ultimately, if the goal is natural language understanding, do letters independently have meaning?\n",
    "\n",
    "What about word level? What if we simply had a value to represent each word for the approximately 600,000 words in the English vocabulary? Wouldn't we have a computer that understands language then? What we've simply done is perform word-level encoding in a similar format like the encoding for characters that already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the solution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "💡To truly understand language, we need a way to also capture the meaning of the word. Meaning can be inferred from context or semantics. What if we had more than one value for each word? \n",
    "\n",
    "👉🏾 **Example:** `[0.0,0.1,0.2,0.3]` for the word machine instead of simply having a value like `43` represent the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The use of vectors for encoding in NLP is pretty common. In fact, virtually all NLP approaches for endoing use vectors, from Bag of Words to Word Embeddings. However, in NLP, we do not necesarilly focus on the entire vocabulary of a language, we treat whatever text we have, known as a **corpus** as the entirerity of the vocabulary. This had been the practice but recent developments with Transformers have shown that the larger the corpus is, the better a model in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier, we asked ourselves how to convert language into a form a computer can process.  \n",
    "Do we assign a number to each word? Or a vector? Or something else entirely?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that virtually all modern NLP techniques from simple Bag of Words to advanced Transformer models rely on **vector representations** of text.  \n",
    "But why vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "**📝 Key Reason:**  \n",
    "**Vectors allow us to capture more than just the identity of a word — they capture relationships, context and meaning.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike assigning a unique number to each word (which only tells the computer that two words are different), a vector can represent **how similar or related two words are**, based on how they're used in language.  \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- *king* and *queen* should have similar vectors.\n",
    "- *apple* and *banana* should be closer in vector space than *apple* and *government*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different NLP techniques build these vectors in differently. The approach to the vector representation of text is the main difference between NLP techniques.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Idea behind Bag of Words:** Any language, has a finite vocabulary/no. of words. However, in NLP we deal with long passages, texts and paragraphs. For any one of these, we certainly will not use the entire vocabulary of that language. Think about it, not unless you crawl the depth of the internet and find every book, article or text ever written, it's very hard to come up with a text that contains all the words in the English vocabulary. Having this in mind, what other way can we numerically represent words in a specific text?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way is to treat all unique words in that document as the entirerity of the vocabulary of the language. Therefore, we can capture the presence or absence of a word in a particular sentence or phrase.

    "##### **👀What did we just do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We already established that encoding is the process of transforming data from one form to another for the purposes of storage, transmission or processing. Specifically for processing in NLP. So we have successfully encoded our data!😀🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean we also encoded the meaning of the words in our document? **No**, natural language understanding requires far more than simply converting text into numerical representation. While it's a start, we need to apply more steps. Which is what more sophisticated approaches such as **Transformers** and **Word2Vec** do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🏆What did we accomplish?**\n",
    "1. We captured the presence and absence of words: this tells us which words appear in a document.\n",
    "2. We captured the frequency of words: indicating how often words appear which can signal word importance or emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear that while BoW does not lead us directly to **Natural Language Understanding**, it does serve as a powerful starting point. Like any other approach, it has its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of BoW**\n",
    "1. **Simple to implement.** \n",
    "2. **Computationally efficient**\n",
    "3. **Language agnostic**: BoW can work for any language.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations of BoW**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Looses word order and context:** In natural language, meaning often depends on word order and surrounding words (context). BoW ignores this, treating each word independently.\n",
    "- **Dimensionality:** The size of the vector grows with the number of unique words in the corpus. Even a small text can produce long, sparse vectors. From our text, a simple 12 sentences text results in vectors of length 117. For much larger corpus, this does not scale well.\n",
    "- **Cannot capture semantic relationships:** BoW doesn’t understand how words relate in meaning. For example, “good” and “great” would be treated as completely unrelated words, even though they are similar in meaning.\n",
    "- **Common words may dominate representations:** In BoW, words that appear frequently across many documents such like “the”, “is”, “and”, or even frequent but unimportant domain-specific words, get higher counts simply because they occur often, not because they’re meaningful or important to the document’s content.\n",
    "This can distort analysis, as these high-frequency but low-value words overshadow rarer, more informative words."

    "\n",
    "It's like we've eagerly walked into a tunnel, excited for the discoveries and adventures that lie ahead but now, the light has faded away behind us. Well, there is some light at the end of the tunnel, we just need to make it there.\n",
    "\n",
    " NLP focuses on the understanding, interpratation and generation of human language. Its true power lies not just in converting text to numbers, but in using those numbers to perform meaningful tasks, called **NLP Tasks**. Some NLP tasks include:\n",
    "1. **Classification of words**: Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence (noun, verb, adjective), or the named entities (person, location, organization).\n",
    "2. **Classification of sentences**: getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not.\n",
    "3. **Generating text content**: Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words\n",
    "4. **Extracting an answer from a text**: Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context\n",

    "While Bag of Words is a good starting point for representing text data in a nunerical format, language is nuanced and thus we need to encode more than simply the occurence and frequency of a word. We need other approaches that build up from the bag of words model. We can attempt to encode the semantics of a word by assigning weights to each word in a document. The higher the weight, the more meaning or value to the text the word carries. This can be done using a technique known as ***TF-IDF***."

This served as a crucial turning point in NLP techniques. More advanced techniques and representations such as **Word Embeddings** build up on having floats/weights rather than integers that simply capture the presence of frequency of a word.\n",

    "All encoding approaches in NLP work towards one goal, to convert language to a numerical format. What sets some approaches apart from other is how much about the language can be captured in these numerical representations. The observed effect of capturing more about a language is better performance on further downstream NLP tasks. Even as we dive deeper into the realm of NLP, it's important to appreaciate that the better our encoding of natural language, the better the results for NLP tasks that rely on these encodings."

    "From the demonstration above, we can clearly see that the weights of tokens in the TF-IDF model we built from scratch are different from the those built using the TfIdf vectroizer class from the scikit-learn library. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well if the underlying formula is the same, **🤷🏿‍♂️Why the difference?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF implementation in the scikit-learn libary is a bit different from that described by the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "**👁️Difference between the two approaches**\n",

    "- Count matrix for the term frequency part(similar to a Bag of Words)\n",
    "- Smoothed inverse document frequency by:\n",
    "    - Adding one to the document count\n",
    "    - Adding one to the count of documents containing token i\n",
    "    - Adding one to the final result of the inverse document frequency part\n",
    "- Normalisation of the final weights\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "tf_{ij} = \\text{Number of occurences of token } i \\text{ in sentence } j\n",

    "The final weight:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w^{norm}_{ij} = \\frac{w_{ij}}  {||w_{j}||}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $||w_{j}||$ is the l2 norming constant for document vector j\n",
    "\n",
    "**🤔Why does the TF-IDF class in sci-kit learn use this approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When algorithms are incorporated into standard libraries, they need to work reliably across diverse applications and data conditions without compromising performance or usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since scikit-learn is primarily a machine learning library, it makes these design choices for practical reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Smoothing the IDF prevents division-by-zero errors and overly extreme values when terms appear in very few or very many documents.\n",
    "2. Normalization ensures that resulting TF-IDF vectors are on a common scale, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accelerates model convergence during training.\n",
    "    - Enables fair distance or similarity comparisons (especially for metrics like cosine similarity).\n",
    "    - Mirrors best practices like feature scaling in numeric ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes scikit-learn’s TF-IDF both robust and ML-friendly by design.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **⏩ Next Steps**\n",
    "Let's re-build our tf-idf model from scratch, this time incorporating these modifications!\n",

    "### **Word2Vec**\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying nuance is that most of the data available in the world is unstructured. One of the forms that unstructured data that has powered the collaboration in advancements of the human race is language(text in our case). It is therefore important to come up with approaches to not only extract insight from text but also attempt to understand it programatically. Why? Well machines are better at crunching numbers than we are and we could leverage this. So any form of data, we can effectively get the most out of it if we can encode it in numerical format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have used `Bag of Words` and `TF_DF` to encode text in numerical form. However, these two approaches come with one shared pitfall, ***they fail to capture the semantics of a word(meaning)***. When I came accross this weakness, I thought to myslef, well, why not simply encode the dictionary in numerical format and let the vector representations of a token in a document interact with that from the dictionary and this will capture the meaning. However, this has a problem; the model created will be good at mathcing a token to its lexical meaning(what is defined in a dictionary) kind of like a lookup table. However, language is quite unfortunately for us more complex than that. See language is made powerful by the unique combination of words to make up phrases and sentences. However, we do not uunderstand the meaning of a phrase or a sentence based of its lexicon, we infer it from the context in which the words have been used, e.g: `The bank was so shallow` can be expressed in lexicon as: ``['article','the bottom of a river','past tense of is','expression of extent' and 'not deep']`` however from the simple sentence we immediately know that `We are referring to a river bank and that it was shallow`. This can only be achieved from context. Therefore, the ideal go to approach would be to focus on capturing **semantic meaning** rather than lexial meaning of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have established that there key thing in decoding the semantic meaning of text:\n",
    "    - `The context in which it has been used` e.g I went to the bank and I got some gold from the river bank \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need an approach to encoding text that captures contextual relationships between words. One such revolutionary approach is **Word2Vec**. Word2Vec has the following architecture:\n",
    "    - You have a corpora of text from a document(a corpora here is simply all the words present in a document). Some pre-processing tasks might have been applied say tokenisation and removing stop words.\n",
    "    - You create a high dimensional vector referred to as an **embedding** say 32 or 64 dimensions.\n",
    "    - The high dimensional vector becomes the unique embedding of that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But how can we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by considering the position in which a word occurs in the text, what is emphasised in transformers through **positional encoding** and ensuring that we process text in the order in which it occurs therefore for each word used in a different context we have a different numerical embedding for it. \n",
    "\n",
    "But yeah great but how do we really do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "I know of 2 approaches native to the word2vec model. A very genius way of determining the context is attempting to predict the next word or a the next group words. There are 2 approaches for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Convolutionary Bag of Words(CBOW)`: convolutionary bag of words attempts to predict the next word given some words e.g: For the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog\" we extract a list of words such as ['the','quick','brown','fox','jumped','over','the','lazy','dog']. From this list we take n words and attempt to predict what the next word will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - say we have n=3, so we condier 3 words in sequence and try and predict the next word we'd have ['the','quick','brown'] to predict ['fox'] and so on hence the name convolutionary bag of words.\n",
    "    This is repated over and over again creating a sequence of features and targets. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Skip-gram`: in this approach we attempt to predict the next series of words/tokens given a single word. So ['quick] to predict say ['brown','fox'].\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach sound easier and more natural but both have their benefits. SKip-gram is especially good for encoding rare words.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have approaches to predicting the next word how does that get us closer to numerical representation of the words?\n",
    "\n",
    "So the engine powering all this is yet another algorithm known as a neural network. An interconnected network of nodes known as neurons. The word embeddings come from the weights of the neural network. The final input weights to the hidden layer after the network is trained. This is hopw it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each token in the corpora is converted into a numerical vector of dimension N say 7(depends on how many unique tokens are present) using one-hot encoding so basically a token such as `fox` would be [0,0,0,0,1,0,1]. We do this for all the tokens where the one marks their presence.\n",
    "2. Some of the token(s) are considered features and another a target and passed to a single input node of a neural network. Attempting to predict the target from the features. A neural netweork will typically have multiple input nodes.\n",
    "3. Weights are initialised randomly for each node as connections to the hidden layer. \n",
    "4. The firt layer of the hidden layer is very crucial, from these the dimension of our word emedding is determined e.g for 32 dimension embedding the first node needs to have 32 neurons for 32 weights for each input node. These weights are what will serve as our input embedding after training is complete. \n",
    "5. The training loop is initiated and after an acceptable loss if attained, the final callibrated weights to the hidden layer are used as word embeddings for each target feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now execution of this seems conplex but is quite simplified by the word2vec model from gensim. Neural networks are known for being notoriously compute hungry. However, the neural network used here is typically a very shallow network.\n",
    "So what happens when you call the word2vec model and pass it your document is the above process is carried out. There are some nuances such as loss optimisation and activations that I have not described for the neural net which we can have some form of control over using the parameters available from the word2Vec model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can then do some interesting things with the embeddings. For instance, how close 2 word embeddings are tells us how similar in meaning two words are and the further apart words are from each other the less likely they are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

      "['world war i or the first world war  july    november  also known as the great war was a global conflict between two coalitions the allies or entente and the central powers. fighting took place mainly in europe and the middle east as well as in parts of africa and the asiapacific and in europe was characterised by trench warfare the widespread use of artillery machine guns and chemical weapons gas and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. world war i was one of the deadliest conflicts in history resulting in an estimated  million military dead and more than  million wounded plus some  million civilian dead from causes including genocide. the movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly spanish flu pandemic.', 'the causes of world war i included the rise of germany and decline of the ottoman empire which disturbed the longstanding balance of power in europe and rising economic competition between nations driven by industrialisation and imperialism. growing tensions between the great powers and in the balkans reached a breaking point on  june  when gavrilo princip a bosnian serb assassinated the heir to the austrohungarian throne. austriahungary blamed serbia and declared war on  july. after russia mobilised in serbias defence germany declared war on russia and france who had an alliance. the united kingdom entered after germany invaded belgium and the ottomans joined the central powers in november. germanys strategy in  was to quickly defeat france then transfer its forces to the east but its advance was halted in september and by the end of the year the western front consisted of a nearcontinuous line of trenches from the english channel to switzerland. the eastern front was more dynamic but neither side gained a decisive advantage despite costly offensives. italy bulgaria romania greece and others joined in from  onward.', 'major battles including at verdun the somme and passchendaele failed to break the stalemate on the western front. in april  the united states joined the allies after germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against atlantic shipping. later that year the bolsheviks seized power in russia in the october revolution soviet russia signed an armistice with the central powers in december followed by a separate peace in march . that month germany launched a spring offensive in the west which despite initial successes left the german army exhausted and demoralised. the allied hundred days offensive beginning in august  caused a collapse of the german front line. following the vardar offensive bulgaria signed an armistice in late september. by early november the ottoman empire and austriahungary had each signed armistices with the allies leaving germany isolated. facing a revolution at home kaiser wilhelm ii abdicated on  november and the war ended with the armistice of  november .', 'the paris peace conference of  imposed settlements on the defeated powers most notably the treaty of versailles by which germany lost significant territories was disarmed and was required to pay large war reparations to the allies. the dissolution of the russian german austrohungarian and ottoman empires redrew national boundaries and resulted in the creation of new independent states including poland finland the baltic states czechoslovakia and yugoslavia. the league of nations was established to maintain world peace but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of world war ii in .', 'before world war ii the events of  were generally known as the great war or simply the world war. in august  the magazine the independent wrote this is the great war. it names itself. in october  the canadian magazine macleans similarly wrote some wars name themselves. this is the great war. contemporary europeans also referred to it as the war to end war and it was also described as the war to end all wars due to their perception of its unparalleled scale devastation and loss of life. the first recorded use of the term first world war was in september  by german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel who stated there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared european war... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.', 'for much of the th century the major european powers maintained a tenuous balance of power known as the concert of europe. after  this was challenged by britains withdrawal into socalled splendid isolation the decline of the ottoman empire new imperialism and the rise of prussia under otto von bismarck. victory in the  francoprussian war allowed bismarck to consolidate a german empire. post the primary aim of french policy was to avenge this defeat but by the early s this had switched to the expansion of the french colonial empire.', 'in  bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors which included austriahungary russia and germany. after the  russoturkish war the league was dissolved due to austrian concerns over the expansion of russian influence in the balkans an area they considered to be of vital strategic interest. germany and austriahungary then formed the  dual alliance which became the triple alliance when italy joined in . for bismarck the purpose of these agreements was to isolate france by ensuring the three empires resolved any disputes among themselves. in  bismarck set up the reinsurance treaty a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austriahungary.', 'for bismarck peace with russia was the foundation of german foreign policy but in  he was forced to retire by wilhelm ii. the latter was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by his new chancellor leo von caprivi. this gave france an opening to agree to the francorussian alliance in  which was then followed by the  entente cordiale with britain. the triple entente was completed by the  anglorussian convention. while not formal alliances by settling longstanding colonial disputes in asia and africa british support for france or russia in any future conflict became a possibility. this was accentuated by british and russian support for france against germany during the  agadir crisis.', 'german economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post. backed by wilhelm ii admiral alfred von tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an imperial german navy that could compete with the british royal navy. this policy was based on the work of us naval author alfred thayer mahan who argued that possession of a bluewater navy was vital for global power projection tirpitz had his books translated into german while wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel.', 'however it was also an emotional decision driven by wilhelms simultaneous admiration for the royal navy and desire to surpass it. bismarck thought that the british would not interfere in europe as long as its maritime supremacy remained secure but his dismissal in  led to a change in policy and an anglogerman naval arms race began. despite the vast sums spent by tirpitz the launch of hmsdreadnought in  gave the british a technological advantage. ultimately the race diverted huge resources into creating a german navy large enough to antagonise britain but not defeat it in  chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg acknowledged defeat leading to the rstungswende or armaments turning point when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army.', 'this decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions but by german concern over russias quick recovery from its defeat in the russojapanese war and the subsequent  russian revolution. economic reforms led to a significant post expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure particularly in its western border regions. since germany and austriahungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to russia the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the royal navy. after germany expanded its standing army by  troops in  france extended compulsory military service from two to three years similar measures were taken by the balkan powers and italy which led to increased expenditure by the ottomans and austriahungary. absolute figures are difficult to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which had logistical importance and military use. it is known however that from  to  military spending by the six major european powers increased by over  in real terms.', 'the years before  were marked by a series of crises in the balkans as other powers sought to benefit from the ottoman decline. while panslavic and orthodox russia considered itself the protector of serbia and other slav states they preferred the strategically vital bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak ottoman government rather than an ambitious slav power like bulgaria. russia had ambitions in northeastern anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the balkans. these competing interests divided russian policymakers and added to regional instability.', 'austrian statesmen viewed the balkans as essential for the continued existence of their empire and saw serbian expansion as a direct threat. the  bosnian crisis began when austria annexed the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina which it had occupied since . timed to coincide with the bulgarian declaration of independence from the ottoman empire this unilateral action was denounced by the european powers but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation. some historians see this as a significant escalation ending any chance of austria cooperating with russia in the balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between serbia and italy.', 'tensions increased after the  italoturkish war demonstrated ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the balkan league an alliance of serbia bulgaria montenegro and greece. the league quickly overran most of the ottomans territory in the balkans during the  first balkan war much to the surprise of outside observers. the serbian capture of ports on the adriatic resulted in partial austrian mobilisation starting on  november  including units along the russian border in galicia. the russian government decided not to mobilise in response unprepared to precipitate a war.', 'the great powers sought to reassert control through the  treaty of london which had created an independent albania while enlarging the territories of bulgaria serbia montenegro and greece. however disputes between the victors sparked the day second balkan war when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on  june  it was defeated losing most of macedonia to serbia and greece and southern dobruja to romania. the result was that even countries which benefited from the balkan wars such as serbia and greece felt cheated of their rightful gains while for austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns including germany. this complex mix of resentment nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre balkans became known as the powder keg of europe.', 'on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir presumptive to emperor franz joseph i of austria visited sarajevo the capital of the recently annexed bosnia and herzegovina. cvjetko popovi gavrilo princip nedeljko abrinovi trifko grabe vaso ubrilovi bosnian serbs and muhamed mehmedbai from the bosniaks community from the movement known as young bosnia took up positions along the archdukes motorcade route to assassinate him. supplied with arms by extremists within the serbian black hand intelligence organisation they hoped his death would free bosnia from austrian rule.', 'abrinovi threw a grenade at the archdukes car and injured two of his aides. the other assassins were also unsuccessful. an hour later as ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers in hospital his car took a wrong turn into a street where gavrilo princip was standing. he fired two pistol shots fatally wounding ferdinand and his wife sophie.', 'according to historian zbynk zeman in vienna the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. on  and  june the crowds listened to music and drank wine as if nothing had happened. nevertheless the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant and has been described by historian christopher clark as a  effect a terrorist event charged with historic meaning transforming the political chemistry in vienna.', 'austrohungarian authorities encouraged subsequent antiserb riots in sarajevo. violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo in other cities in austrohungariancontrolled bosnia and herzegovina croatia and slovenia. austrohungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned approximately  prominent serbs  to  of whom died in prison. a further  serbs were sentenced to death. a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs.', 'the assassination initiated the july crisis a month of diplomatic manoeuvring among austriahungary germany russia france and britain. believing that serbian intelligence helped organise franz ferdinands murder austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end serbian interference in bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this. however the foreign ministry had no solid proof of serbian involvement. on july austria delivered an ultimatum to serbia listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities.', 'serbia ordered general mobilisation on july but accepted all the terms except for those empowering austrian representatives to suppress subversive elements inside serbia and take part in the investigation and trial of serbians linked to the assassination. claiming this amounted to rejection austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day on  july they declared war on serbia and began shelling belgrade. russia ordered general mobilisation in support of serbia on  july.', 'anxious to ensure backing from the spd political opposition by presenting russia as the aggressor german chancellor bethmann hollweg delayed the commencement of war preparations until  july. that afternoon the russian government were handed a note requiring them to cease all war measures against germany and austriahungary within  hours. a further german demand for neutrality was refused by the french who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war. the german general staff had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts the schlieffen plan envisaged using  of the army to defeat france then switching to russia. since this required them to move quickly mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon. once the german ultimatum to russia expired on the morning of  august the two countries were at war.', 'at a meeting on  july the british cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to belgium under the  treaty of london did not require it to oppose a german invasion with military force however prime minister asquith and his senior cabinet ministers were already committed to supporting france the royal navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention. on  july britain sent notes to germany and france asking them to respect belgian neutrality france pledged to do so but germany did not reply. aware of german plans to attack through belgium french commanderinchief joseph joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and preempt such a move. to avoid violating belgian neutrality he was told any advance could come only after a german invasion. instead the french cabinet ordered its army to withdraw km behind the german frontier to avoid provoking war. on  august germany occupied luxembourg and exchanged fire with french units when german patrols entered french territory on august they declared war on france and demanded free passage across belgium which was refused. early on the morning of august the germans invaded and albert i of belgium called for assistance under the treaty of london. britain sent germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from belgium when this expired at midnight without a response the two empires were at war.', 'germany promised to support austriahungarys invasion of serbia but interpretations of what this meant differed. previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in  but those had never been tested in exercises. austrohungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia.', 'beginning on  august the austrians and serbs clashed at the battles of the cer and kolubara over the next two weeks austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses. as a result austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front weakening their efforts against russia. serbias victory against austriahungary in the  invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century. in  the campaign saw the first use of antiaircraft warfare after an austrian plane was shot down with groundtoair fire as well as the first medical evacuation by the serbian army.', 'upon mobilisation in accordance with the schlieffen plan  of the german army was located on the western front with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east. rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier the german right wing would sweep through the netherlands and belgium then swing south encircling paris and trapping the french army against the swiss border. the plans creator alfred von schlieffen head of the german general staff from  to  estimated that this would take six weeks after which the german army would transfer to the east and defeat the russians.', 'the plan was substantially modified by his successor helmuth von moltke the younger. under schlieffen  of german forces in the west were assigned to the right wing with the remainder holding along the frontier. by keeping his leftwing deliberately weak he hoped to lure the french into an offensive into the lost provinces of alsacelorraine which was the strategy envisaged by their plan xvii. however moltke grew concerned that the french might push too hard on his left flank and as the german army increased in size from  to  he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings to . he also considered dutch neutrality essential for german trade and cancelled the incursion into the netherlands which meant any delays in belgium threatened the viability of the plan. historian richard holmes argues that these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success.', 'the initial german advance in the west was very successful. by the end of august the allied left which included the british expeditionary force bef was in full retreat and the french offensive in alsacelorraine was a disastrous failure with casualties exceeding . german planning provided broad strategic instructions while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front but alexander von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris. the french army reinforced by the british expeditionary corps seized this opportunity to counterattack and pushed the german army  to km back. both armies were then so exhausted that no decisive move could be implemented so they settled in trenches with the vain hope of breaking through as soon as they could build local superiority.', 'in  the russian stavka agreed with the french to attack germany within fifteen days of mobilisation ten days before the germans had anticipated although it meant the two russian armies that entered east prussia on  august did so without many of their support elements.', 'by the end of  german troops held strong defensive positions inside france controlled the bulk of frances domestic coalfields and inflicted  more casualties than it lost itself. however communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long twofront war. as was apparent to several german leaders this amounted to a strategic defeat shortly after the first battle of the marne crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter we have lost the war. it will go on for a long time but lost it is already.', 'on  august  new zealand occupied german samoa now samoa. on  september the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of new britain then part of german new guinea. on  october the german cruiser smsemden sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang. japan declared war on germany before seizing territories in the pacific which later became the south seas mandate as well as german treaty ports on the chinese shandong peninsula at tsingtao. after vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser smskaiserin elisabeth from tsingtao japan declared war on austriahungary and the ship was sunk in november . within a few months allied forces had seized all german territories in the pacific leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea.', 'some of the first clashes of the war involved british french and german colonial forces in africa. on  august french and british troops invaded the german protectorates of togoland and kamerun. on  august german forces in southwest africa attacked south africa sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. the german colonial forces in german east africa led by colonel paul von lettowvorbeck fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe.', 'before the war germany had attempted to use indian nationalism and panislamism to its advantage a policy continued post by instigating uprisings in india while the niedermayerhentig expedition urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers. however contrary to british fears of a revolt in india the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity. leaders from the indian national congress and other groups believed support for the british war effort would hasten indian home rule a promise allegedly made explicit in  by edwin montagu the secretary of state for india.', 'in  the british indian army was larger than the british army itself and between  and  an estimated .million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe africa and the middle east. in all soldiers served on the western front and nearly  in the middle east with  killed and  wounded. the suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the british government to grant selfgovernment to india afterward bred disillusionment resulting in the campaign for full independence led by mahatma gandhi.', 'prewar military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in . technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances such as barbed wire machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult. both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. in time technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons such as gas warfare and the tank.', 'after the first battle of the marne in september  allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other a series of manoeuvres later known as the race to the sea. by the end of  the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the channel to the swiss border. since the germans were normally able to choose where to stand they generally held the high ground while their trenches tended to be better built those constructed by the french and english were initially considered temporary only needed until an offensive would destroy the german defences. both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. on  april  at the second battle of ypres the germans violating the hague convention used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front. several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides and though it never proved a decisive battlewinning weapon it became one of the most feared and bestremembered horrors of the war.', 'in february  the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun lasting until december . casualties were greater for the french but the germans bled heavily as well with anywhere from  to  casualties between the two combatants. verdun became a symbol of french determination and selfsacrifice.', 'the battle of the somme was an anglofrench offensive from july to november . the opening day on  july  was the bloodiest single day in the history of the british army which suffered  casualties including  dead. as a whole the somme offensive led to an estimated  british casualties along with  french and  germans. the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. the living conditions led to disease and infection such as trench foot lice typhus trench fever and the spanish flu.', 'at the start of the war german cruisers were scattered across the globe some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping. these were systematically hunted down by the royal navy though not before causing considerable damage. one of the most successful was the smsemden part of the german east asia squadron stationed at qingdao which seized or sank  merchantmen a russian cruiser and a french destroyer. most of the squadron was returning to germany when it sank two british armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel in november  before being virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december. the sms dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries but after the battle of ms a tierra these too were either destroyed or interned.', 'soon after the outbreak of hostilities britain began a naval blockade of germany. this proved effective in cutting off vital supplies though it violated accepted international law. britain also mined international waters which closed off entire sections of the ocean even to neutral ships. since there was limited response to this tactic germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.', 'the battle of jutland in mayjune  was the only fullscale clash of battleships during the war and one of the largest in history. the clash was indecisive though the germans inflicted more damage than they received thereafter the bulk of the german high seas fleet was confined to port.', 'german uboats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain. the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. the united states launched a protest and germany changed its rules of engagement. after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in  germany promised not to target passenger liners while britain armed its merchant ships placing them beyond the protection of the cruiser rules which demanded warning and movement of crews to a place of safety a standard that lifeboats did not meet. finally in early  germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare realising the americans would eventually enter the war. germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas but after initial successes eventually failed to do so.', 'the uboat threat lessened in  when merchant ships began travelling in convoys escorted by destroyers. this tactic made it difficult for uboats to find targets which significantly lessened losses after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced destroyers could potentially successfully attack a submerged submarine. convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled the solution was an extensive program of building new freighters. troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys. the uboats sunk more than  allied ships at the cost of  submarines.', 'world war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat with hmsfurious launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july  as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol.', 'faced with russia in the east austriahungary could spare only onethird of its army to attack serbia. after suffering heavy losses the austrians briefly occupied the serbian

defeat retreated into northern albania. the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo. montenegro covered the serbian retreat toward the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac on  january  but

but these forces were too weak to reestablish a front.', 'the allied breakthrough on the macedonian front cut communications between the ottoman empire and the other central powers and made vienna

sea java sea and indian ocean and bombed the allied naval base at darwin australia. in january  the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha. these easy victories over the unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident and overextended.', 'in early may  japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia. the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force centred on two american fleet carriers fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea. japans next plan motivated by the earlier doolittle raid was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated as a diversion japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska. in midmay japan started the zhejiangjiangxi campaign in china with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying chinese air bases and fighting against the chinese rd and nd army groups. in early june japan put its operations into action but the americans had broken japanese naval codes in late may and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy.', 'with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle japan attempted to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua. the americans planned

factors such as germany and japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force allied strategic bombing and germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. additionally neither

developed considerably. innovations included airlift the capability to quickly move limited highpriority supplies equipment and personnel and strategic bombing the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemys ability to wage war. antiaircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surfacetoair artillery in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.', 'advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at taranto pearl harbor and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship. in the atlantic escort carriers became a vital part of allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the midatlantic gap. carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured. submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. the british focused development on antisubmarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics. gradually improving allied technologies such as the leigh light hedgehog squid and homing torpedoes proved effective against german submarines.', 'land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of world wari which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry to increased mobility and combined arms. the tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war had evolved into the primary weapon. in the late s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world wari and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower. at the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and german doctrine of avoiding tankversustank combat. this along with germanys use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france. many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery antitank guns both towed and selfpropelled mines shortranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used. even with largescale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to world wari. the portable machine gun spread a notable example being the german mg  and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings. the assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.', 'most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using

a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long new england winters. after rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walledin gymnasiums he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.

passes and dribbling to be unpredictable. eventually a lacefree ball construction method was invented and this change to the game was endorsed by naismith whereas in american football the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day. the first balls made specifically for basketball were brown and it was only in the late s that tony hinkle searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. dribbling was not part of the original game except for the bounce pass to

this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. the backboard was introduced to prevent this interference it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.

choose to call them by different designations.', 'there are two main defensive strategies zone defense and mantoman defense. in a zone defense each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the

varied normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. a quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut. a legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate by standing in the defenders way such that the teammate cuts next to him is a screen or pick. the two plays are combined in the pick and roll in which a player sets a pick and then rolls away from the pick towards the basket. screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. on court the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.', 'shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket methods varying with players and situations.', 'typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. a player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand the shooting arm slightly above the head with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. the ball is usually shot by jumping though not always and extending the shooting arm. the shooting arm fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball known as a followthrough. players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. the ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial but generally a proper arc is recommended. players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.', 'the two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot. both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot. in a set shot the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor this is typically used for free throws. for a jump shot the throw is taken in midair with the ball being released near the top of the jump. this provides much greater power and range and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.', 'another common shot is called the layup. this shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket and to lay the ball up and into the basket typically off the backboard the backboardfree underhand version is called a finger roll. the most crowdpleasing and typically highestpercentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward through the basket while touching it.', 'another shot that is less common than the layup is the circus shot. the circus shot is a lowpercentage shot that is flipped heaved scooped or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is offbalance airborne falling down or facing away from the basket. a backshot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket and may be shot with the dominant hand or both but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.', 'a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball. a particularly bad shot or one that only hits the backboard is jocularly called a brick. the hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping either to make a slam dunk layup or jump shot.', 'the objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. this plays a major role in the game as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. there are two categories of rebounds offensive rebounds in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession and defensive rebounds in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. the majority of rebounds are defensive as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots for example about  of rebounds in the nba are defensive.', 'a pass is a method of moving the ball between players. most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.', 'a staple pass is the chest pass. the ball is passed directly from the passers chest to the receivers chest. a proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.', 'another type of pass is the bounce pass. here the passer bounces the ball crisply about twothirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. the ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. the bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept kicking the ball deliberately is a violation. thus players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments or to pass around a defender.', 'the overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender. the ball is released while over the passers head.', 'the outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. the next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass.', 'the crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. a special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. this is called a nolook pass.', 'another advanced style of passing is the behindtheback pass which as the description implies involves throwing the ball behind the passers back to a teammate. although some players can perform such a pass effectively many coaches discourage nolook or behindtheback passes believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations.', 'dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. to dribble a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it this ensures greater control.', 'when dribbling past an opponent the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. it is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.', 'good dribblers or ball handlers tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand making it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball. good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs between their legs and switch directions suddenly making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. this is called a crossover which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.', 'a skilled player can dribble without watching the ball using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the balls location. by not having to focus on the ball a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from himher.', 'a block is performed when after a shot is attempted a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. in almost all variants of play it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc this is known as goaltending. it is also illegal under nba and mens ncaa basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. after the ball hits the rim it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed.', 'to block a shot a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. thus height can be an advantage in blocking. players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. however with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap even shorter players can be effective shot

accords in .', 'the planners at bretton woods hoped to avoid a repetition of the treaty of versailles after world war i which had created enough economic and political tension to lead to wwii. after world war i britain owed the u.s. substantial sums which britain could not repay because it had used the funds to support allies such as france during the war the allies could not pay back britain so britain could not pay back the u.s. the solution at versailles for the french british and americans seemed to entail ultimately charging germany for the debts. if the demands on germany were unrealistic then it was unrealistic for france to pay back britain and for britain to pay back the us. thus many assets on bank balance sheets internationally were actually unrecoverable loans which culminated in the  banking crisis. intransigent insistence by creditor countries for the repayment of allied war debts and reparations combined with an inclination to isolationism led to a breakdown of the international financial system and a worldwide economic depression.', 'the beggar thy neighbour policies that emerged as the crisis continued saw some trading countries using currency

haphazardly constructed nationally motivated and imposed. the various anarchic and often autarkic protectionist and neomercantilist national policies  often mutually inconsistent  that emerged over the first half of the decade worked inconsistently and selfdefeatingly to promote national import substitution increase national exports divert foreign investment and trade flows and even prevent certain categories of crossborder trade and investment outright. global central bankers attempted to manage the situation by meeting with each other but their understanding of the situation as well as difficulties in communicating internationally hindered their abilities. the lesson was that simply having responsible hardworking central bankers was not enough.', 'britain in the s had an exclusionary trade bloc with countries and territories of the british empire known as the sterling area. if britain imported more than it exported to such trading partners recipients of pounds sterling within these countries tended to put them into london banks. this meant that though britain was running a trade deficit it had a financial account surplus and payments balanced. increasingly britains positive balance of payments required keeping the wealth from across its empire in british banks. one incentive for say south african holders of rand to park their wealth in london and to keep the money in sterling was a strongly valued pound sterling. in the s imports from the us threatened certain parts of the british domestic market for manufactured goods and the way out of the trade deficit was to devalue the currency. but britain could not devalue or the empire surplus would leave its banking system.', 'nazi germany also worked with a bloc of controlled countries by . germany forced trading partners with a surplus to spend that surplus importing products from germany. thus britain survived by keeping sterlingusing countries surpluses in its banking system and germany survived by forcing trading partners to purchase its own products. the u.s. was concerned that a sudden dropoff in war spending might return its population to the unemployment levels of the s and so wanted sterlingusing countries and everyone in europe to be able to import from the us hence the u.s. supported free trade and international convertibility of currencies into gold or dollars.', 'when many of the same experts who observed the s became the architects of a new unified postwar system at bretton woods their guiding principles became no more beggar thy neighbor and control flows of speculative financial capital. preventing a repetition of this process of competitive devaluations was desired but in a way that would not force debtor countries to contract their industrial bases by keeping interest rates at a level high enough to attract foreign bank deposits. john maynard keynes wary of repeating the great depression was behind britains proposal that surplus countries be forced by a useitorloseit mechanism to either import from debtor states build factories in debtor states or donate to debtor states. the u.s. opposed keynes plan and a senior official at the u.s. treasury harry dexter white rejected keynes proposals in favor of an international monetary fund with enough resources to counteract destabilizing flows of speculative finance. however unlike the modern imf whites proposed fund would have counteracted dangerous speculative flows automatically with no political strings attachedi.e. no imf conditionality. economic historian brad delong writes that on almost every point where he was overruled by the americans keynes was later proved correct by events.', 'today these key s events look different to scholars of the era see the work of barry eichengreen golden fetters the gold standard and the great depression  and how to prevent a currency war in particular devaluations today are viewed with more nuance. ben bernankes opinion on the subject follows', '... he proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... for a variety of reasons including a desire of the federal reserve to curb the u.s. stock market boom monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late sa contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. what was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of  instigated an international scramble for gold. sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries  substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices output and employment. effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints but disputes over world war i reparations and war debts and the insularity and inexperience of the federal reserve among other factors prevented this outcome. as a result individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and reestablishing domestic monetary stability a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until france and the other gold bloc countries finally left gold in . great depression b. bernanke', 'in  at bretton woods as a result of the collective conventional wisdom of the time representatives from all the leading allied states collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates indirectly disciplined by a us dollar tied to golda system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. this meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment fdii.e. construction of factories overseas rather than international currency manipulation or bond markets. although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system all agreed on the need for tight controls.', 'also based on experience of the interwar years u.s. planners developed a concept of economic securitythat a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace. one of those who saw such a security link was cordell hull the united states secretary of state from  to . hull believed that the fundamental causes of the two world wars lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare. hull argued', 'nhampered trade dovetailed with peace high tariffs trade barriers and unfair economic competition with war  if we could get a freer flow of tradefreer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructionsso that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance of lasting peace.', 'the developed countries also agreed that the liberal international economic system required governmental intervention. in the aftermath of the great depression public management of the economy had emerged as a primary activity of governments in the developed states. employment stability and growth were now important subjects of public policy.', 'in turn the role of government in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic wellbeing. the system of economic protection for atrisk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the great depression which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy and out of the theoretical contributions of the keynesian school of economics which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections.', 'however increased government intervention in domestic economy brought with it isolationist sentiment that had a profoundly negative effect on international economics. the priority of national goals independent national action in the interwar period and the failure to perceive that those national goals could not be realized without some form of international collaborationall resulted in beggarthyneighbor policies such as high tariffs competitive devaluations that contributed to the breakdown of the goldbased international monetary system domestic political instability and international war. the lesson learned was as the principal architect of the bretton woods system new dealer harry dexter white put it', 'the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will  inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale.', 'to ensure economic stability and political peace states agreed to cooperate to closely regulate the production of their currencies to maintain fixed exchange rates between countries with the aim of more easily facilitating international trade. this was the foundation of the u.s. vision of postwar world free trade which also involved lowering tariffs and among other things maintaining a balance of trade via fixed exchange rates that would be favorable to the capitalist system.', 'thus the more developed market economies agreed with the u.s. vision of postwar international economic management which intended to create and maintain an effective international monetary system and foster the reduction of barriers to trade and capital flows. in a sense the new international monetary system was a return to a system similar to the prewar gold standard only using u.s. dollars as the worlds new reserve currency until international trade reallocated the worlds gold supply.', 'thus the new system would be devoid initially of governments meddling with their currency supply as they had during the years of economic turmoil preceding wwii. instead governments would closely police the production of their currencies and ensure that they would not artificially manipulate their price levels. if anything bretton woods was a return to a time devoid of increased governmental intervention in economies and currency systems.', 'the atlantic charter drafted during u.s. president franklin d. roosevelts august  meeting with british prime minister winston churchill on a ship in the north atlantic was the most notable precursor to the bretton

underlined the way financial power had moved from the uk to the us.', 'a devastated britain had little choice. two world wars had destroyed the countrys principal industries that paid for the

negotiators at the bretton woods conference fresh from what they perceived as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the s concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall the free flow of trade.', 'the new economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment trade and payments. unlike national economies however the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. in the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard but the architects of bretton woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. instead they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the u.s. dollar which was a gold standard currency for central banks as a reserve currency.', 'in the th and early th centuries gold played a key role in international monetary transactions. the gold standard was used to back currencies the international value of currency was determined by its fixed relationship to gold gold was used to settle international accounts. the gold standard maintained fixed exchange rates that were seen as desirable because they reduced the risk when trading with other countries.', 'imbalances in international trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. a country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. the resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports thus the deficit would be rectified. any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend.', 'this decrease in the amount of money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure. supplementing the use of gold in this period was the british pound. based on the dominant british economy the pound became a reserve transaction and intervention currency. but the pound was not up to the challenge of serving as the primary world currency given the weakness of the british economy after the second world war.', 'the architects of bretton woods had conceived of a system wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal. yet in an era of more activist economic policy governments did not seriously consider permanently fixed rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the th century. gold production was not even sufficient to meet the demands of growing international trade and investment. further a sizable share of the worlds known gold reserves was located in the soviet union which would later emerge as a cold war rival to the united states and western europe.', 'the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the u.s. dollar. the strength of the u.s. economy the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold  an ounce and the commitment of the u.s. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. in fact the dollar was even better than gold it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold.', 'the rules of bretton woods set forth in the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd provided for a system of fixed exchange rates. the rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the convertibility of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade.', 'what emerged was the pegged rate currency regime. members were required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the reserve currency a peg and to maintain exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity a band by intervening in their foreign exchange markets that is buying or selling foreign money.', 'in theory the reserve currency would be the bancor a world currency unit that was never implemented proposed by john maynard keynes however the united states objected and their request was granted making the reserve currency the u.s. dollar. this meant that other countries would peg their currencies to the u.s. dollar andonce convertibility was restoredwould buy and sell u.s. dollars to keep market exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity. thus the u.s. dollar took over the role that gold had played under the gold standard in the international financial system.', 'meanwhile to bolster confidence in the dollar the u.s. agreed separately to link the dollar to gold at the rate of  per ounce. at this rate foreign governments and central banks could exchange dollars for gold. bretton woods established a system of payments based on the dollar which defined all currencies in relation to the dollar itself convertible into gold and above all as good as gold for trade. u.s. currency was now effectively the world currency the standard to which every other currency was pegged.', 'the u.s. dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and it was the only currency that was backed by gold. additionally all european states that had been involved in world war ii were highly in debt and transferred large amounts of gold into the united states a fact that contributed to the supremacy of the united states. thus the u.s. dollar was strongly appreciated in the rest of the world and therefore became the key currency of the bretton woods system.', 'member countries could only change their par value by more than  with imf approval which was contingent on imf determination that its balance of payments was in a fundamental disequilibrium. the formal definition of fundamental disequilibrium was never determined leading to uncertainty of approvals and attempts to repeatedly devalue by less than  instead. any country that changed without approval or after being denied approval was denied access to the imf.', 'maintaining the fixed exchange system required countries to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves to intervene in markets and prevent fluctuations away from the pegged rate. this also meant that international movement of capital could not be too large because that might lead to large fluctuations in the exchange rate and necessitate costly market interventions that risked depleting a countrys foreign exchange reserves.', 'the bretton woods conference led to the establishment of the imf and the ibrd now the world bank which remain powerful forces in the world economy as of the s.', 'a major point of common ground at the conference was the goal to avoid a recurrence of the closed markets and economic warfare that had characterized the s. thus negotiators at bretton woods also agreed that there was a need for an institutional forum for international cooperation on monetary matters. already in  the british economist john maynard keynes emphasized the importance of rulebased regimes to stabilize business expectationssomething he accepted in the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates. currency troubles in the interwar years it was felt had been greatly exacerbated by the absence of any established procedure or machinery for intergovernmental consultation.', 'as a result of the establishment of agreed upon structures and rules of international economic interaction conflict over economic issues was minimized and the significance of the economic aspect of international relations seemed to recede.', 'officially established on  december  when the  participating countries at the conference of bretton woods signed its articles of agreement the imf was to be the keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management. the fund commenced its financial operations on  march . imf approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of . it advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system and lent reserve currencies to countries that had incurred balance of payment debts.', 'the big question at the bretton woods conference with respect to the institution that would emerge as the imf was the issue of future access to international liquidity and whether that source should be akin to a world central bank able to create new reserves at will or a more limited borrowing mechanism.', 'although attended by  governments discussions at the conference were dominated by two rival plans developed by the united states and britain. writing to the british treasury keynes who took the lead at the conference did not want many countries. he believed that those from the colonies and semicolonies had nothing to contribute and will merely encumber the ground.', 'as the chief international economist at the u.s. treasury in  harry dexter white drafted the u.s. blueprint for international access to liquidity which competed with the plan drafted for the british treasury by keynes. overall whites scheme tended to favor incentives designed to create price stability within the worlds economies while keynes wanted a system that encouraged economic growth. the collective agreement was an enormous international undertaking that took two years prior to the conference to prepare for. it consisted of numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings to reach common ground on what policies would make up the bretton woods system.', 'at the time gaps between the white and keynes plans seemed enormous. white basically wanted a fund to reverse destabilizing flows of financial capital automatically. white proposed a new monetary institution called the stabilization fund that would be funded with a finite pool of national currencies and gold that would effectively limit the supply of reserve credit. keynes wanted incentives for the u.s. to help britain and the rest of europe rebuild after wwii. outlining the difficulty of creating a system that every nation could accept in his speech at the closing plenary session of the bretton woods conference on  july  keynes stated', 'we the delegates of this conference mr president have been trying to accomplish something very difficult to accomplish. it has been our task to find a common measure a common standard a common rule acceptable to each and not irksome to any.', 'keynes proposals would have established a world reserve currency which he thought might be called bancor administered by a central bank vested with the power to create money and with the authority to take actions on a much larger scale.', 'in the case of balance of payments imbalances keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. as outlined by keynes countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries build factories in debtor countries or donate to themand thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. thus keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much of the burden on the deficit country would be deflationary.',

countries in gold and their own currencies. the original quotas were to total . billion. when joining the imf members are assigned quotas that reflect their relative economic powerand as a sort of credit deposit are obliged to pay a subscription of an amount commensurate with the quota. they pay the subscription as  in gold or currency convertible into gold effectively the dollar which at the founding was the only currency then still directly gold convertible for central banks and  in their own currency.', 'quota subscriptions form the largest source of money at the imfs disposal. the imf set out to use this money to grant loans to member countries with financial difficulties. each member is then entitled to withdraw  of its quota immediately in case of payment problems. if this sum should be insufficient each nation in the system is also able to request loans for foreign currency.', 'in the event of a deficit in the current account fund members when short of reserves would be able to borrow foreign currency in amounts determined by the size of its quota. in other words the higher the countrys contribution was the higher the sum of money it could borrow from the imf.', 'members were required to pay back debts within a period of  months to five years. in turn the imf embarked on setting up rules and procedures to keep a country from going too deeply into debt year

with balance of payments deficits. shortrun balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by imf loans which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. this flexibility meant a member state would not have to induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means. thus countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. before the second world war european governmentsparticularly britainoften resorted to this.', 'the imf sought to provide for occasional discontinuous exchangerate adjustments changing a members par value by international agreement. member states were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by . this tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports. this would be allowed only if there was a fundamental

surpluses and u.s. reserves were immense and growing. it was necessary to reverse this flow. even though all countries wanted to buy u.s. exports dollars had to leave the united states and become

of dollars to gold was allowed but was not required. governments could forgo converting dollars to gold and instead hold dollars. rather than full convertibility the system provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. however there was still an open gold market. for the bretton woods system to remain workable it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold or it would have to maintain the free market price for gold near the  per ounce official price. the greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the bretton woods price and selling it on the open market.', 'in  robert triffin a belgianamerican economist noticed that holding dollars was more valuable than gold because constant u.s. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. what would later come to be known as triffins dilemma was predicted when triffin noted that if the u.s. failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity not be able to keep up with the worlds economic growth and thus bring the system to a halt. but incurring such payment deficits also meant that over time the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability.', 'the first effort was the creation of the london gold pool on  november  between eight governments. the theory behind the pool was that spikes in the free market price of gold set by the morning gold fix in london could be controlled by having a pool of gold to sell on the open market that would then be recovered when the price of gold dropped. golds price spiked in response to events such as the cuban missile crisis and other less significant events to as high as ounce. the kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports. this culminated with the  tax cut program designed to maintain the  peg.', 'in  there was an attack on the pound and a run on gold in the sterling area and on  november  the british government was forced to devalue the pound. u.s. president lyndon baines johnson was faced with a difficult choice either institute protectionist measures including travel taxes export subsidies and slashing the budgetor accept the risk of a run on gold and

on gold ensued through the free market in london the london gold pool was dissolved initially by the institution of ad hoc uk bank holidays at the request of the u.s. government. this was followed by

repealed the  requirement of gold backing of the dollaras well as the u.s. pledge to suspend gold sales to governments that trade in the private markets led to the expansion of the private markets for

continued to build up their own gold reserves.', 'in the s and s important structural changes eventually led to the breakdown of international monetary management. one change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence. the stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to convertibility of the western european currencies at the end of  and of the japanese yen in . convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions which deepened monetary interdependence.', 'the eurodollar market grew from zero before  to  billion in . euromarkets increased international credit liquidity and volatility. capital flows began to dwarf domestic and international efforts to regulate capital movements.', 'another aspect of the internationalization of banking has been the emergence of international banking consortia. since  various banks had formed international syndicates and by  over threequarters of the worlds largest banks had become shareholders in such syndicates. multinational banks can and do make large international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations.', 'these new forms of monetary interdependence made large capital flows possible. during the bretton woods era countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. because such changes had a direct impact on certain domestic economic groups they came to be seen as political risks for leaders. as a result official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms providing a virtually riskfree temptation for speculators. they could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. if however monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation they could return to other currencies with no loss. the combination of riskfree speculation with the availability of large sums was highly destabilizing.', 'a second structural change that undermined monetary management was the decline of u.s. hegemony. the u.s. was no longer the dominant economic power it had been for more than two decades. by the mids the e.e.c. and japan had become international economic powers in their own right. with total reserves exceeding those of the u.s. higher levels of growth and trade and per capita income approaching that of the u.s. europe and japan were narrowing the gap between themselves and the united states.', 'the shift toward a more pluralistic distribution of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the u.s. dollar as the international currency. acting effectively as the worlds central banker the u.s. through its deficit determined the level of international liquidity. in an increasingly interdependent world u.s. policy significantly influenced economic conditions in europe and japan. in addition as long as other countries were willing to hold dollars the u.s. could carry out massive foreign expenditures for political purposesmilitary activities and foreign aidwithout the threat of balanceofpayments constraints.', 'dissatisfaction with the political implications of the dollar system was increased by dtente between the u.s. and the soviet union. the soviet military threat had been an important force in cementing the u.s.led monetary system. the u.s. political and security umbrella helped make american economic domination palatable for europe and japan which had been economically exhausted by the war. as gross domestic production grew in european countries trade grew. when common security tensions lessened this loosened the transatlantic dependence on defence concerns and allowed latent economic tensions to surface.', 'reinforcing the relative decline in u.s. power and the dissatisfaction of europe and japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollarthe foundation that had underpinned the post global trading system. the vietnam war and the refusal of the administration of u.s. president lyndon b. johnson to pay for it and its great society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and rampant inflation which led to the deterioration of the u.s. balance of trade position. in the late s the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position while the german mark and the yen were undervalued and naturally the germans and the japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive whereas the u.s. sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation. meanwhile the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new international currency markets with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits.', 'in contrast upon the creation of bretton woods with the u.s. producing half of the worlds manufactured goods and holding half its reserves the twin burdens of international management and the cold war were possible to meet at first. throughout the s washington sustained a balance of payments deficit to

importantly closed the gold window making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly except on the open market. unusually this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own state department and was soon dubbed the nixon shock.', 'the august shock was followed by efforts under u.s. leadership to reform the international monetary system. throughout the fall autumn of  a series of multilateral and bilateral negotiations between the group of ten countries took place seeking to redesign the exchange rate regime.', 'meeting in december  at the smithsonian institution in washington d.c. the group of ten signed the smithsonian agreement. the u.s. pledged to peg the dollar at ounce with . trading bands and other countries agreed to appreciate their currencies versus the dollar. the group also planned to balance the world financial system using special drawing rights alone.', 'the agreement failed to encourage discipline by the federal reserve or the united states government. the federal reserve was concerned about an increase in the domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. in an attempt to undermine the efforts of the smithsonian agreement the federal reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. with the smithsonian agreement member countries anticipated a return flow of dollars to the u.s. but the reduced interest rates within the united states caused dollars to continue to flow out of the u.s. and into foreign central banks. the inflow of dollars into foreign banks continued the monetization of the dollar overseas defeating the aims of the smithsonian agreement. as a result the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate soon after a  devaluation was announced in february  japan and the eec countries decided to let their currencies float. this proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the bretton woods system. the end of bretton woods was formally ratified by the jamaica accords in . by the early s all industrialised states were using floating currencies.', 'during the  financial crisis some policymakers such as james chace and others called for a new international monetary system that some of them also dub bretton woods ii.', 'on

which outlines the need for coordinated fiscal response on the part of central banks around the world to address the ongoing economic crisis.', 'the bretton woods system played a key role in shaping the postwar global economy but its structure also led to significant challenges. while it initially provided monetary stability and facilitated economic growth it placed a heavy reliance on the u.s. dollar as the central reserve currency. this gave the united states considerable influence over the international financial system and allowed it to run persistent trade and budget deficits with fewer immediate consequences than other nations. fixed exchange rates a defining feature of the system provided stability but also limited the flexibility of national governments to respond to economic shifts sometimes leading to economic strain.', 'as global trade expanded maintaining the system became increasingly difficult. rising inflation and growing u.s. trade deficits in the s created tensions particularly among european nations and japan which sought more control over their monetary policies. the systems collapse in the early s led to the widespread adoption of floating exchange rates marking a significant shift in global finance. the institutions created under bretton woods particularly the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have also been the subject of ongoing debate. critics argue that these institutions while intended to promote global financial stability and development have often imposed loan conditions that disproportionately burden developing nations. the world bank has faced scrutiny for funding projects linked to environmental and social disruptions while the imf has been criticized for enforcing austerity measures that some argue have deepened economic crises rather than alleviated them. critics also note that the imf prioritizes the stability of financial institutions over individual economic freedoms restricting the ability of local markets to selfcorrect and develop organically.', 'the systems collapse also contributed to broader discussions on alternative monetary arrangements. some economists and policymakers have advocated for a return to a commoditybacked system while others have proposed a global reserve currency independent of any single nation similar to keynes earlier concept of the bancor. more recently decentralized financial systems including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been suggested as alternatives to governmentcontrolled monetary systems with proponents arguing that they offer a way

recovery.', 'there is a really good reason for tighter credit. tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression. this matters for credit decisions. a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car andor have a default placed on their credit record. on the other hand a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. in the case of businesses their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. profit prospects look much worse in november  than they did in november ... while many banks are obviously at the brink consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. the problem with the economy is the loss of close to  trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth.', '...the pace of economic contraction is slowing. conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses lower housing wealth and tight credit. businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in

has also conducted several innovative lending programs to improve liquidity and strengthen different financial institutions and markets such as freddie mac and fannie mae. in this case the major problem in the market is the lack of free cash reserves and flows to secure the loans. the federal reserve took many steps to deal with financial market liquidity worries. one of these steps was a credit line for major traders who act as the feds partners in open market activities. also loan programs were set up to make the money market mutual funds and commercial paper market more flexible. also the term assetbacked securities loan facility talf was put in place thanks to a joint effort with the us department of the treasury. this plan made it easier for consumers and businesses to get credit by giving americans who owned highquality assetbacked securities more credit.', 'before the crisis the federal reserves stocks of treasury securities were sold to pay for the increase in credit. this method was meant to keep banks from trying to give out their extra savings which could cause the federal funds rate to drop below where it was supposed to be. however in october  the federal reserve was granted the power to provide banks with interest payments on their surplus reserves. this created a motivation for banks to retain their reserves instead of disbursing them thus reducing the need for the federal reserve to hedge its increased lending by decreases in alternative assets.', 'money market funds also went through runs when people lost faith in the market. to keep it from getting worse the fed said it would give money to mutual fund companies. also department of treasury said that it would briefly cover the assets of the fund. both of these things helped get

what they still owed on their mortgages.', 'while the causes of the bubble and subsequent crash are disputed the precipitating factor for the financial crisis of  was the bursting of the united states housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of mortgage loans particularly adjustablerate mortgages. some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis', 'the relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in subprime lending. subprime had not become less risky wall street just accepted this higher risk.', 'due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers. in the view of some analysts the relatively conservative governmentsponsored

competition from private securitizers undermined gse power mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. the riskiest loans were originated in  the years of the most intense competition

their own portfolios.', 'in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission conservative american enterprise institute fellow peter j. wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the united states department of housing and urban development hud in the s and to massive

other analysts the delay between cra rule changes in  and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising and does not exonerate the cra. they contend that there were two connected causes to the

the crisis could take place. critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive totaling . trillion in the years between  and . they also argue that the federal reserves classification of cra loans as prime is based on the faulty and selfserving assumption that highinterestrate loans  percentage points over average equal subprime loans.', 'others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. in an article in portfolio magazine michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that there werent enough americans with

delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the   deflated. according to wallison the reason the u.s. residential housing bubble as opposed to other types of bubbles led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loansgenerally with low or no downpayments.', 'krugmans contention that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that u.s. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis is challenged by additional analysis. after researching the default of commercial loans

'in a peabody awardwinning program npr correspondents argued that a giant pool of money represented by  trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade. this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from  to  yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast. investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgagebacked security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.', 'in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the us with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small

mainly the emerging economies in asia and oilexporting nations. the balance of payments identity requires that a country such as the us running a current account deficit also have a capital account investment surplus of the same amount. hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds capital flowed into the u.s. to finance its imports.', 'all of this created demand for various types of financial assets raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates as high as  in china or because of high oil prices. ben bernanke referred to this as a saving glut.', 'a flood of funds capital or liquidity reached the u.s. financial markets. foreign governments supplied funds by

during adverse economic conditions can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior as ultimately one persons consumption is another persons income. too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. economist hyman minsky also described a paradox of deleveraging as financial institutions that have too much leverage debt relative to equity cannot all deleverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.', 'in april  federal reserve vicechair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes', 'once this massive credit crunch hit it didnt take long before we were in a recession. the recession in turn deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell and credit losses of financial institutions surged. indeed we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. consumers are pulling back on purchases especially on durable goods to build their savings. businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. and financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. once again minsky understood this dynamic. he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as

the default of a borrower or to assist with obtaining financing. examples pertinent to this crisis included the adjustablerate mortgage the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgagebacked securities mbs or collateralized debt obligations cdo for sale to investors a type of securitization and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps cds. the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.', 'cdo issuance grew from an estimated  billion in q  to its peak of over  billion by q  then declined back under  billion by q . further the credit quality of cdos declined from  to  as the level of subprime and other nonprime mortgage debt increased from  to  of cdo assets. as described in the section on subprime lending the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. for example buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo when those cdos became worthless.', 'this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage including mortgage brokers specialized originators the securitizers and their due diligence firms managing agents and trading desks and finally investors insurances and providers of repo funding. with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information including fico scores on creditworthiness appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks. instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts misjudgments and finally market collapse. economists have studied the crisis as an instance of cascades in financial networks where institutions instability destabilized other institutions and led to knockon effects.', 'martin wolf chief economics commentator at the financial times wrote in june  that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations such as offbalance sheet

assetbacked products and their derivatives by originators securitizers brokerdealers ratingagencies insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors with the exception of certain hedge funds. while financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk.', 'for a variety of reasons market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system. the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. banks estimated that  billion of cdo were sold between

requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of aigs failure.', 'the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood. this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgagebacked securities. because it was highly tractable it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors issuers

mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were. george soros commented that the superboom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. similarly the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products. it was a shocking abdication of responsibility.', 'a conflict of interest between investment management professional and institutional investors combined with a global glut in investment capital led to bad investments by asset managers in overpriced credit assets. professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. there is therefore an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. many asset managers continued to invest client funds in overpriced underyielding investments to the detriment of their clients so they could maintain their assets under management. they supported this choice with a plausible deniability of the risks associated with subprimebased credit assets because the loss experience with early vintages of subprime loans was so low.', 'despite the dominance of the

banking system also called the shadow banking system. these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. further these entities were vulnerable because of assetliability mismatch meaning that they borrowed shortterm in liquid markets to purchase longterm illiquid and risky assets. this meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging selling their longterm assets at depressed prices. he described the significance of these entities', 'in early  assetbacked commercial paper conduits in structured investment vehicles in auctionrate preferred securities tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes had a combined asset size of roughly . trillion. assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to . trillion. assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly . trillion. the combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled  trillion. in comparison the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over  trillion and total assets of the entire banking system were about  trillion. the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to selfreinforcing asset price and credit cycles.', 'economist paul krugman laureate of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences described the run on the shadow banking system as the core of what happened to cause the crisis. he referred to this lack of controls as malign neglect and argued that regulation

intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai.', 'alan turing wrote in  i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour. he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind. turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.', 'russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure. however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence.', 'mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems. the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible.', 'another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai. this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.', 'some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way.', 'no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history. the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks. this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow. critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers.', 'symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics. they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests. in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.', 'however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult. philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him.', 'the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias. critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research

described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks. scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. neats defend their

more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.', 'there is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior. mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. russell and norvig add that he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on. however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.', 'david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness. the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion. while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain. for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.', 'computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem. this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam.', 'philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby

      "world war i or the first world war  july    november  also known as the great war was a global conflict between two coalitions the allies or entente and the central powers. fighting took place mainly in europe and the middle east as well as in parts of africa and the asiapacific and in europe was characterised by trench warfare the widespread use of artillery machine guns and chemical weapons gas and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. world war i was one of the deadliest conflicts in history resulting in an estimated  million military dead and more than  million wounded plus some  million civilian dead from causes including genocide. the movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly spanish flu pandemic..the causes of world war i included the rise of germany and decline of the ottoman empire which disturbed the longstanding balance of power in europe and rising economic competition between nations driven by industrialisation and imperialism. growing tensions between the great powers and in the balkans reached a breaking point on  june  when gavrilo princip a bosnian serb assassinated the heir to the austrohungarian throne. austriahungary blamed serbia and declared war on  july. after russia mobilised in serbias defence germany declared war on russia and france who had an alliance. the united kingdom entered after germany invaded belgium and the ottomans joined the central powers in november. germanys strategy in  was to quickly defeat france then transfer its forces to the east but its advance was halted in september and by the end of the year the western front consisted of a nearcontinuous line of trenches from the english channel to switzerland. the eastern front was more dynamic but neither side gained a decisive advantage despite costly offensives. italy bulgaria romania greece and others joined in from  onward..major battles including at verdun the somme and passchendaele failed to break the stalemate on the western front. in april  the united states joined the allies after germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against atlantic shipping. later that year the bolsheviks seized power in russia in the october revolution soviet russia signed an armistice with the central powers in december followed by a separate peace in march . that month germany launched a spring offensive in the west which despite initial successes left the german army exhausted and demoralised. the allied hundred days offensive beginning in august  caused a collapse of the german front line. following the vardar offensive bulgaria signed an armistice in late september. by early november the ottoman empire and austriahungary had each signed armistices with the allies leaving germany isolated. facing a revolution at home kaiser wilhelm ii abdicated on  november and the war ended with the armistice of  november ..the paris peace conference of  imposed settlements on the defeated powers most notably the treaty of versailles by which germany lost significant territories was disarmed and was required to pay large war reparations to the allies. the dissolution of the russian german austrohungarian and ottoman empires redrew national boundaries and resulted in the creation of new independent states including poland finland the baltic states czechoslovakia and yugoslavia. the league of nations was established to maintain world peace but its failure to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of world war ii in ..before world war ii the events of  were generally known as the great war or simply the world war. in august  the magazine the independent wrote this is the great war. it names itself. in october  the canadian magazine macleans similarly wrote some wars name themselves. this is the great war. contemporary europeans also referred to it as the war to end war and it was also described as the war to end all wars due to their perception of its unparalleled scale devastation and loss of life. the first recorded use of the term first world war was in september  by german biologist and philosopher ernst haeckel who stated there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared european war... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word..for much of the th century the major european powers maintained a tenuous balance of power known as the concert of europe. after  this was challenged by britains withdrawal into socalled splendid isolation the decline of the ottoman empire new imperialism and the rise of prussia under otto von bismarck. victory in the  francoprussian war allowed bismarck to consolidate a german empire. post the primary aim of french policy was to avenge this defeat but by the early s this had switched to the expansion of the french colonial empire..in  bismarck negotiated the league of the three emperors which included austriahungary russia and germany. after the  russoturkish war the league was dissolved due to austrian concerns over the expansion of russian influence in the balkans an area they considered to be of vital strategic interest. germany and austriahungary then formed the  dual alliance which became the triple alliance when italy joined in . for bismarck the purpose of these agreements was to isolate france by ensuring the three empires resolved any disputes among themselves. in  bismarck set up the reinsurance treaty a secret agreement between germany and russia to remain neutral if either were attacked by france or austriahungary..for bismarck peace with russia was the foundation of german foreign policy but in  he was forced to retire by wilhelm ii. the latter was persuaded not to renew the reinsurance treaty by his new chancellor leo von caprivi. this gave france an opening to agree to the francorussian alliance in  which was then followed by the  entente cordiale with britain. the triple entente was completed by the  anglorussian convention. while not formal alliances by settling longstanding colonial disputes in asia and africa british support for france or russia in any future conflict became a possibility. this was accentuated by british and russian support for france against germany during the  agadir crisis..german economic and industrial strength continued to expand rapidly post. backed by wilhelm ii admiral alfred von tirpitz sought to use this growth to build an imperial german navy that could compete with the british royal navy. this policy was based on the work of us naval author alfred thayer mahan who argued that possession of a bluewater navy was vital for global power projection tirpitz had his books translated into german while wilhelm made them required reading for his advisors and senior military personnel..however it was also an emotional decision driven by wilhelms simultaneous admiration for the royal navy and desire to surpass it. bismarck thought that the british would not interfere in europe as long as its maritime supremacy remained secure but his dismissal in  led to a change in policy and an anglogerman naval arms race began. despite the vast sums spent by tirpitz the launch of hmsdreadnought in  gave the british a technological advantage. ultimately the race diverted huge resources into creating a german navy large enough to antagonise britain but not defeat it in  chancellor theobald von bethmann hollweg acknowledged defeat leading to the rstungswende or armaments turning point when he switched expenditure from the navy to the army..this decision was not driven by a reduction in political tensions but by german concern over russias quick recovery from its defeat in the russojapanese war and the subsequent  russian revolution. economic reforms led to a significant post expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure particularly in its western border regions. since germany and austriahungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to russia the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the royal navy. after germany expanded its standing army by  troops in  france extended compulsory military service from two to three years similar measures were taken by the balkan powers and italy which led to increased expenditure by the ottomans and austriahungary. absolute figures are difficult to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which had logistical importance and military use. it is known however that from  to  military spending by the six major european powers increased by over  in real terms..the years before  were marked by a series of crises in the balkans as other powers sought to benefit from the ottoman decline. while panslavic and orthodox russia considered itself the protector of serbia and other slav states they preferred the strategically vital bosporus straits to be controlled by a weak ottoman government rather than an ambitious slav power like bulgaria. russia had ambitions in northeastern anatolia while its clients had overlapping claims in the balkans. these competing interests divided russian policymakers and added to regional instability..austrian statesmen viewed the balkans as essential for the continued existence of their empire and saw serbian expansion as a direct threat. the  bosnian crisis began when austria annexed the former ottoman territory of bosnia and herzegovina which it had occupied since . timed to coincide with the bulgarian declaration of independence from the ottoman empire this unilateral action was denounced by the european powers but accepted as there was no consensus on how to resolve the situation. some historians see this as a significant escalation ending any chance of austria cooperating with russia in the balkans while also damaging diplomatic relations between serbia and italy..tensions increased after the  italoturkish war demonstrated ottoman weakness and led to the formation of the balkan league an alliance of serbia bulgaria montenegro and greece. the league quickly overran most of the ottomans territory in the balkans during the  first balkan war much to the surprise of outside observers. the serbian capture of ports on the adriatic resulted in partial austrian mobilisation starting on  november  including units along the russian border in galicia. the russian government decided not to mobilise in response unprepared to precipitate a war..the great powers sought to reassert control through the  treaty of london which had created an independent albania while enlarging the territories of bulgaria serbia montenegro and greece. however disputes between the victors sparked the day second balkan war when bulgaria attacked serbia and greece on  june  it was defeated losing most of macedonia to serbia and greece and southern dobruja to romania. the result was that even countries which benefited from the balkan wars such as serbia and greece felt cheated of their rightful gains while for austria it demonstrated the apparent indifference with which other powers viewed their concerns including germany. this complex mix of resentment nationalism and insecurity helps explain why the pre balkans became known as the powder keg of europe..on  june  archduke franz ferdinand of austria heir presumptive to emperor franz joseph i of austria visited sarajevo the capital of the recently annexed bosnia and herzegovina. cvjetko popovi gavrilo princip nedeljko abrinovi trifko grabe vaso ubrilovi bosnian serbs and muhamed mehmedbai from the bosniaks community from the movement known as young bosnia took up positions along the archdukes motorcade route to assassinate him. supplied with arms by extremists within the serbian black hand intelligence organisation they hoped his death would free bosnia from austrian rule..abrinovi threw a grenade at the archdukes car and injured two of his aides. the other assassins were also unsuccessful. an hour later as ferdinand was returning from visiting the injured officers in hospital his car took a wrong turn into a street where gavrilo princip was standing. he fired two pistol shots fatally wounding ferdinand and his wife sophie..according to historian zbynk zeman in vienna the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. on  and  june the crowds listened to music and drank wine as if nothing had happened. nevertheless the impact of the murder of the heir to the throne was significant and has been described by historian christopher clark as a  effect a terrorist event charged with historic meaning transforming the political chemistry in vienna..austrohungarian authorities encouraged subsequent antiserb riots in sarajevo. violent actions against ethnic serbs were also organised outside sarajevo in other cities in austrohungariancontrolled bosnia and herzegovina croatia and slovenia. austrohungarian authorities in bosnia and herzegovina imprisoned approximately  prominent serbs  to  of whom died in prison. a further  serbs were sentenced to death. a predominantly bosniak special militia known as the schutzkorps was established and carried out the persecution of serbs..the assassination initiated the july crisis a month of diplomatic manoeuvring among austriahungary germany russia france and britain. believing that serbian intelligence helped organise franz ferdinands murder austrian officials wanted to use the opportunity to end serbian interference in bosnia and saw war as the best way of achieving this. however the foreign ministry had no solid proof of serbian involvement. on july austria delivered an ultimatum to serbia listing ten demands made intentionally unacceptable to provide an excuse for starting hostilities..serbia ordered general mobilisation on july but accepted all the terms except for those empowering austrian representatives to suppress subversive elements inside serbia and take part in the investigation and trial of serbians linked to the assassination. claiming this amounted to rejection austria broke off diplomatic relations and ordered partial mobilisation the next day on  july they declared war on serbia and began shelling belgrade. russia ordered general mobilisation in support of serbia on  july..anxious to ensure backing from the spd political opposition by presenting russia as the aggressor german chancellor bethmann hollweg delayed the commencement of war preparations until  july. that afternoon the russian government were handed a note requiring them to cease all war measures against germany and austriahungary within  hours. a further german demand for neutrality was refused by the french who ordered general mobilisation but delayed declaring war. the german general staff had long assumed they faced a war on two fronts the schlieffen plan envisaged using  of the army to defeat france then switching to russia. since this required them to move quickly mobilisation orders were issued that afternoon. once the german ultimatum to russia expired on the morning of  august the two countries were at war..at a meeting on  july the british cabinet had narrowly decided its obligations to belgium under the  treaty of london did not require it to oppose a german invasion with military force however prime minister asquith and his senior cabinet ministers were already committed to supporting france the royal navy had been mobilised and public opinion was strongly in favour of intervention. on  july britain sent notes to germany and france asking them to respect belgian neutrality france pledged to do so but germany did not reply. aware of german plans to attack through belgium french commanderinchief joseph joffre asked his government for permission to cross the border and preempt such a move. to avoid violating belgian neutrality he was told any advance could come only after a german invasion. instead the french cabinet ordered its army to withdraw km behind the german frontier to avoid provoking war. on  august germany occupied luxembourg and exchanged fire with french units when german patrols entered french territory on august they declared war on france and demanded free passage across belgium which was refused. early on the morning of august the germans invaded and albert i of belgium called for assistance under the treaty of london. britain sent germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from belgium when this expired at midnight without a response the two empires were at war..germany promised to support austriahungarys invasion of serbia but interpretations of what this meant differed. previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in  but those had never been tested in exercises. austrohungarian leaders believed germany would cover its northern flank against russia..beginning on  august the austrians and serbs clashed at the battles of the cer and kolubara over the next two weeks austrian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses. as a result austria had to keep sizeable forces on the serbian front weakening their efforts against russia. serbias victory against austriahungary in the  invasion has been called one of the major upset victories of the twentieth century. in  the campaign saw the first use of antiaircraft warfare after an austrian plane was shot down with groundtoair fire as well as the first medical evacuation by the serbian army..upon mobilisation in accordance with the schlieffen plan  of the german army was located on the western front with the remainder acting as a screening force in the east. rather than a direct attack across their shared frontier the german right wing would sweep through the netherlands and belgium then swing south encircling paris and trapping the french army against the swiss border. the plans creator alfred von schlieffen head of the german general staff from  to  estimated that this would take six weeks after which the german army would transfer to the east and defeat the russians..the plan was substantially modified by his successor helmuth von moltke the younger. under schlieffen  of german forces in the west were assigned to the right wing with the remainder holding along the frontier. by keeping his leftwing deliberately weak he hoped to lure the french into an offensive into the lost provinces of alsacelorraine which was the strategy envisaged by their plan xvii. however moltke grew concerned that the french might push too hard on his left flank and as the german army increased in size from  to  he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings to . he also considered dutch neutrality essential for german trade and cancelled the incursion into the netherlands which meant any delays in belgium threatened the viability of the plan. historian richard holmes argues that these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success..the initial german advance in the west was very successful. by the end of august the allied left which included the british expeditionary force bef was in full retreat and the french offensive in alsacelorraine was a disastrous failure with casualties exceeding . german planning provided broad strategic instructions while allowing army commanders considerable freedom in carrying them out at the front but alexander von kluck used this freedom to disobey orders opening a gap between the german armies as they closed on paris. the french army reinforced by the british expeditionary corps seized this opportunity to counterattack and pushed the german army  to km back. both armies were then so exhausted that no decisive move could be implemented so they settled in trenches with the vain hope of breaking through as soon as they could build local superiority..in  the russian stavka agreed with the french to attack germany within fifteen days of mobilisation ten days before the germans had anticipated although it meant the two russian armies that entered east prussia on  august did so without many of their support elements..by the end of  german troops held strong defensive positions inside france controlled the bulk of frances domestic coalfields and inflicted  more casualties than it lost itself. however communications problems and questionable command decisions cost germany the chance of a decisive outcome while it had failed to achieve the primary objective of avoiding a long twofront war. as was apparent to several german leaders this amounted to a strategic defeat shortly after the first battle of the marne crown prince wilhelm told an american reporter we have lost the war. it will go on for a long time but lost it is already..on  august  new zealand occupied german samoa now samoa. on  september the australian naval and military expeditionary force landed on the island of new britain then part of german new guinea. on  october the german cruiser smsemden sank the russian cruiser zhemchug in the battle of penang. japan declared war on germany before seizing territories in the pacific which later became the south seas mandate as well as german treaty ports on the chinese shandong peninsula at tsingtao. after vienna refused to withdraw its cruiser smskaiserin elisabeth from tsingtao japan declared war on austriahungary and the ship was sunk in november . within a few months allied forces had seized all german territories in the pacific leaving only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in new guinea..some of the first clashes of the war involved british french and german colonial forces in africa. on  august french and british troops invaded the german protectorates of togoland and kamerun. on  august german forces in southwest africa attacked south africa sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. the german colonial forces in german east africa led by colonel paul von lettowvorbeck fought a guerrilla warfare campaign and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in europe..before the war germany had attempted to use indian nationalism and panislamism to its advantage a policy continued post by instigating uprisings in india while the niedermayerhentig expedition urged afghanistan to join the war on the side of central powers. however contrary to british fears of a revolt in india the outbreak of the war saw a reduction in nationalist activity. leaders from the indian national congress and other groups believed support for the british war effort would hasten indian home rule a promise allegedly made explicit in  by edwin montagu the secretary of state for india..in  the british indian army was larger than the british army itself and between  and  an estimated .million indian soldiers and labourers served in europe africa and the middle east. in all soldiers served on the western front and nearly  in the middle east with  killed and  wounded. the suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the british government to grant selfgovernment to india afterward bred disillusionment resulting in the campaign for full independence led by mahatma gandhi..prewar military tactics that had emphasised open warfare and individual riflemen proved obsolete when confronted with conditions prevailing in . technological advances allowed the creation of strong defensive systems largely impervious to massed infantry advances such as barbed wire machine guns and above all far more powerful artillery which dominated the battlefield and made crossing open ground extremely difficult. both sides struggled to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. in time technology enabled the production of new offensive weapons such as gas warfare and the tank..after the first battle of the marne in september  allied and german forces unsuccessfully tried to outflank each other a series of manoeuvres later known as the race to the sea. by the end of  the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the channel to the swiss border. since the germans were normally able to choose where to stand they generally held the high ground while their trenches tended to be better built those constructed by the french and english were initially considered temporary only needed until an offensive would destroy the german defences. both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. on  april  at the second battle of ypres the germans violating the hague convention used chlorine gas for the first time on the western front. several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides and though it never proved a decisive battlewinning weapon it became one of the most feared and bestremembered horrors of the war..in february  the germans attacked french defensive positions at the battle of verdun lasting until december . casualties were greater for the french but the germans bled heavily as well with anywhere from  to  casualties between the two combatants. verdun became a symbol of french determination and selfsacrifice..the battle of the somme was an anglofrench offensive from july to november . the opening day on  july  was the bloodiest single day in the history of the british army which suffered  casualties including  dead. as a whole the somme offensive led to an estimated  british casualties along with  french and  germans. the diseases that emerged in the trenches were a major killer on both sides. the living conditions led to disease and infection such as trench foot lice typhus trench fever and the spanish flu..at the start of the war german cruisers were scattered across the globe some of which were subsequently used to attack allied merchant shipping. these were systematically hunted down by the royal navy though not before causing considerable damage. one of the most successful was the smsemden part of the german east asia squadron stationed at qingdao which seized or sank  merchantmen a russian cruiser and a french destroyer. most of the squadron was returning to germany when it sank two british armoured cruisers at the battle of coronel in november  before being virtually destroyed at the battle of the falkland islands in december. the sms dresden escaped with a few auxiliaries but after the battle of ms a tierra these too were either destroyed or interned..soon after the outbreak of hostilities britain began a naval blockade of germany. this proved effective in cutting off vital supplies though it violated accepted international law. britain also mined international waters which closed off entire sections of the ocean even to neutral ships. since there was limited response to this tactic germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare..the battle of jutland in mayjune  was the only fullscale clash of battleships during the war and one of the largest in history. the clash was indecisive though the germans inflicted more damage than they received thereafter the bulk of the german high seas fleet was confined to port..german uboats attempted to cut the supply lines between north america and britain. the nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival. the united states launched a protest and germany changed its rules of engagement. after the sinking of the passenger ship rms lusitania in  germany promised not to target passenger liners while britain armed its merchant ships placing them beyond the protection of the cruiser rules which demanded warning and movement of crews to a place of safety a standard that lifeboats did not meet. finally in early  germany adopted a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare realising the americans would eventually enter the war. germany sought to strangle allied sea lanes before the united states could transport a large army overseas but after initial successes eventually failed to do so..the uboat threat lessened in  when merchant ships began travelling in convoys escorted by destroyers. this tactic made it difficult for uboats to find targets which significantly lessened losses after the hydrophone and depth charges were introduced destroyers could potentially successfully attack a submerged submarine. convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled the solution was an extensive program of building new freighters. troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the north atlantic in convoys. the uboats sunk more than  allied ships at the cost of  submarines..world war i also saw the first use of aircraft carriers in combat with hmsfurious launching sopwith camels in a successful raid against the zeppelin hangars at tondern in july  as well as blimps for antisubmarine patrol..faced with russia in the east austriahungary could spare only onethird of its army to attack serbia. after suffering heavy losses the austrians briefly occupied the serbian capital belgrade. a serbian counterattack in the battle of kolubara succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of . for the first  months of  austriahungary used most of its military reserves to fight italy. german and austrohungarian diplomats scored a coup by persuading bulgaria to join the attack on serbia. the austrohungarian provinces of slovenia croatia and bosnia provided troops for austriahungary. montenegro allied itself with serbia..bulgaria declared war on serbia on  october  and joined in the attack by the austrohungarian army under mackensens army of  that was already underway. serbia was conquered in a little more than a month as the central powers now including bulgaria sent in  troops in total. the serbian army fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat retreated into northern albania. the serbs suffered defeat in the battle of kosovo. montenegro covered the serbian retreat toward the adriatic coast in the battle of mojkovac on  january  but ultimately the austrians also conquered montenegro. the surviving serbian soldiers were evacuated to greece. after the conquest serbia was divided between austrohungary and bulgaria..in late  a francobritish force landed at salonica in greece to offer assistance and to pressure its government to declare war against the central powers. however the progerman king constantine i dismissed the proallied government of eleftherios venizelos before the allied expeditionary force arrived..the macedonian front was at first mostly static. french and serbian forces retook limited areas of macedonia by recapturing bitola on  november  following the costly monastir offensive which brought stabilisation of the front..serbian and french troops finally made a breakthrough in september  in the vardar offensive after most german and austrohungarian troops had been withdrawn. the bulgarians were defeated at the battle of dobro pole and by  september british and french troops had crossed the border into bulgaria proper as the bulgarian army collapsed. bulgaria capitulated four days later on  september . the german high command responded by despatching troops to hold the line but these forces were too weak to reestablish a front..the allied breakthrough on the macedonian front cut communications between the ottoman empire and the other central powers and made vienna vulnerable to attack. hindenburg and ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the central powers and a day after the bulgarian collapse insisted on an immediate peace settlement..the ottomans threatened russias caucasian territories and britains communications with india via the suez canal. the ottoman empire took advantage of the european powers preoccupation with the war and conducted largescale ethnic cleansing of the armenian greek and assyrian christian populationsthe armenian genocide greek genocide and assyrian genocide respectively..the british and french opened overseas fronts with the gallipoli  and mesopotamian campaigns . in gallipoli the ottoman empire successfully repelled the british french and australian and new zealand army corps anzacs. in mesopotamia by contrast after the defeat of the british defenders in the siege of kut by the ottomans  british imperial forces reorganised and captured baghdad in march . the british were aided in mesopotamia by local arab and assyrian fighters while the ottomans employed local kurdish and turcoman tribes..the suez canal was defended from ottoman attacks in  and  in august  a german and ottoman force was defeated at the battle of romani by the anzac mounted division and the nd lowland infantry division. following this victory an egyptian expeditionary force advanced across the sinai peninsula pushing ottoman forces back in the battle of magdhaba in december and the battle of rafa on the border between the egyptian sinai and ottoman palestine in january ..russian armies generally had success in the caucasus campaign. enver pasha supreme commander of the ottoman armed forces dreamed of reconquering central asia and areas that had been previously lost to russia. he was however a poor commander. he launched an offensive against the russians in the caucasus in december  with  troops insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous russian positions in winter. he lost  of his force at the battle of sarikamish. general nikolai yudenich the russian commander from  to  drove the turks out of most of the southern caucasus..the ottoman empire with german support invaded persia modern iran in december  to cut off british and russian access to petroleum reservoirs around baku. persia ostensibly neutral had long been under british and russian influence. the ottomans and germans were aided by kurdish and azeri forces together with a large number of major iranian tribes while the russians and british had the support of armenian and assyrian forces. the persian campaign lasted until  and ended in failure for the ottomans and their allies. however the russian withdrawal from the war in  led armenian and assyrian forces to be cut off from supply lines outnumbered outgunned and isolated forcing them to fight and flee towards british lines in northern mesopotamia..the arab revolt instigated by the british foreign office started in june  with the battle of mecca led by sharif hussein. the sharif declared the independence of the kingdom of hejaz and with british assistance conquered much of ottomanheld arabia resulting finally in the ottoman surrender of damascus. fakhri pasha the ottoman commander of medina resisted for more than  years during the siege of medina before surrendering in january ..the senussi tribe along the border of italian libya and british egypt incited and armed by the turks waged a smallscale guerrilla war against allied troops. the british were forced to dispatch  troops to oppose them in the senussi campaign. their rebellion was finally crushed in mid..total allied casualties on the ottoman fronts amounted to  men. total ottoman casualties were  with  dead and  wounded..though italy joined the triple alliance in  a treaty with its traditional austrian enemy was so controversial that subsequent governments denied its existence and the terms were only made public in . this arose from nationalist designs on austrohungarian territory in trentino the austrian littoral rijeka and dalmatia considered vital to secure the borders established in . in  rome secretly had agreed with france to remain neutral if the latter was attacked by germany effectively nullifying its role in the triple alliance..when the war began in  italy argued the triple alliance was defensive and it was not obliged to support an austrian attack on serbia. opposition to joining the central powers increased when turkey became a member in september since in  italy had occupied ottoman possessions in libya and the dodecanese islands. to secure italian neutrality the central powers offered them tunisia while in return for an immediate entry into the war the allies agreed to their demands for austrian territory and sovereignty over the dodecanese. although they remained secret these provisions were incorporated into the april  treaty of london italy joined the triple entente and on  may declared war on austriahungary followed by germany fifteen months later..the pre italian army was short of officers trained men adequate transport and modern weapons by april  some of these deficiencies had been remedied but it was still unprepared for the major offensive required by the treaty of london. the advantage of superior numbers was offset by the difficult terrain much of the fighting took place high in the alps and dolomites where trench lines had to be cut through rock and ice and keeping troops supplied was a major challenge. these issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics. between  and  the italian commander luigi cadorna undertook a series of frontal assaults along the isonzo which made little progress and cost many lives by the end of the war italian combat deaths totalled around ..in the spring of  the austrohungarians counterattacked in asiago in the strafexpedition but made little progress and were pushed by the italians back to tyrol. although italy occupied southern albania in may  their main focus was the isonzo front which after the capture of gorizia in august  remained static until october . after a combined austrogerman force won a major victory at caporetto cadorna was replaced by armando diaz who retreated more than  kilometres mi before holding positions along the piave river. a second austrian offensive was repulsed in june . on  october diaz launched the battle of vittorio veneto and initially met stubborn resistance but with austriahungary collapsing hungarian divisions in italy demanded they be sent home. when this was granted many others followed and the imperial army disintegrated the italians taking over  prisoners. on november the armistice of villa giusti ended hostilities between austriahungary and italy which occupied trieste and areas along the adriatic sea awarded to it in ..as previously agreed with french president raymond poincar russian plans at the start of the war were to simultaneously advance into austrian galicia and east prussia as soon as possible. although their attack on galicia was largely successful and the invasions achieved their aim of forcing germany to divert troops from the western front the speed of mobilisation meant they did so without much of their heavy equipment and support functions. these weaknesses contributed to russian defeats at tannenberg and the masurian lakes in august and september  forcing them to withdraw from east prussia with heavy losses. by spring  they had also retreated from galicia and the may  gorlicetarnw offensive allowed the central powers to invade russianoccupied poland..despite the successful june  brusilov offensive against the austrians in eastern galicia shortages of supplies heavy losses and command failures prevented the russians from fully exploiting their victory. however it was one of the most significant offensives of the war diverting german resources from verdun relieving austrohungarian pressure on the italians and convincing romania to enter the war on the side of the allies on  august. it also fatally weakened both the austrian and russian armies whose offensive capabilities were badly affected by their losses and increased disillusion with the war that ultimately led to the russian revolutions..meanwhile unrest grew in russia as tsar nicholas ii remained at the front with the home front controlled by empress alexandra. her increasingly incompetent rule and food shortages in urban areas led to widespread protests and the murder of her favourite grigori rasputin at the end of ..despite secretly agreeing to support the triple alliance in  romania increasingly found itself at odds with the central powers over their support for bulgaria in the balkan wars and the status of ethnic romanian communities in hungariancontrolled transylvania which comprised an estimated .million of the regions .million population. with the ruling elite split into progerman and proentente factions romania remained neutral for two years while allowing germany and austria to transport military supplies and advisors across romanian territory..in september  russia acknowledged romanian rights to austrohungarian territories including transylvania and banat whose acquisition had widespread popular support and russian success against austria led romania to join the entente in the august  treaty of bucharest. under the strategic plan known as hypothesis z the romanian army planned an offensive into transylvania while defending southern dobruja and giurgiu against a possible bulgarian counterattack. on  august  they attacked transylvania and occupied substantial parts of the province before being driven back by the recently formed german th army led by former chief of staff erich von falkenhayn. a combined germanbulgarianturkish offensive captured dobruja and giurgiu although the bulk of the romanian army managed to escape encirclement and retreated to bucharest which surrendered to the central powers on  december ..in the summer of  a central powers offensive began in romania under the command of august von mackensen to knock romania out of the war resulting in the battles of oituz mrti and mreti where up to  central powers troops were present. the battles lasted from  july to  september and eventually the romanian army was victorious advancing km. august von mackensen could not plan for another offensive as he had to transfer troops to the italian front. following the russian revolution romania found itself alone on the eastern front and signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers which recognised romanian sovereignty over bessarabia in return for ceding control of passes in the carpathian mountains to austriahungary and leasing its oil wells to germany. although approved by parliament king ferdinand i refused to sign it hoping for an allied victory in the west. romania reentered the war on  november  on the side of the allies and the treaty of bucharest was formally annulled by the armistice of  november ..on  december  after ten brutal months of the battle of verdun and a successful offensive against romania germany attempted to negotiate a peace with the allies. however this attempt was rejected out of hand as a duplicitous war ruse..us president woodrow wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker asking for both sides to state their demands. lloyd georges war cabinet considered the german offer to be a ploy to create divisions among the allies. after initial outrage and much deliberation they took wilsons note as a separate effort signalling that the us was on the verge of entering the war against germany following the submarine outrages. while the allies debated a response to wilsons offer the germans chose to rebuff it in favour of a direct exchange of views. learning of the german response the allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of  january. they sought restoration of damages the evacuation of occupied territories reparations for france russia and romania and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. the allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars. the negotiations failed and the entente powers rejected the german offer on the grounds of honour and noted germany had not put forward any specific proposals..by the end of  russian casualties totalled nearly five million killed wounded or captured with major urban areas affected by food shortages and high prices. in march  tsar nicholas ordered the military to forcibly suppress strikes in petrograd but the troops refused to fire on the crowds. revolutionaries set up the petrograd soviet and fearing a leftwing takeover the state duma forced nicholas to abdicate and established the russian provisional government which confirmed russias willingness to continue the war. however the petrograd soviet refused to disband creating competing power centres and causing confusion and chaos with frontline soldiers becoming increasingly demoralised..following the tsars abdication vladimir leninwith the help of the german governmentwas ushered from switzerland into russia on  april . discontent and the weaknesses of the provisional government led to a rise in the popularity of the bolshevik party led by lenin which demanded an immediate end to the war. the revolution of november was followed in december by an armistice and negotiations with germany. at first the bolsheviks refused the german terms but when german troops began marching across ukraine unopposed they acceded to the treaty of brestlitovsk on march . the treaty ceded vast territories including finland estonia latvia lithuania and parts of poland and ukraine to the central powers..with the russian empire out of the war romania found itself alone on the eastern front and signed the treaty of bucharest with the central powers in may . under the terms of the treaty romania ceded territory to austriahungary and bulgaria and leased its oil reserves to germany. however the terms also included the central powers recognition of the union of bessarabia with romania..the united states was a major supplier of war material to the allies but remained neutral in  in large part due to domestic opposition. the most significant factor in creating the support wilson needed was the german submarine offensive which not only cost american lives but paralysed trade as ships were reluctant to put to sea..on  april  congress declared war on germany as an associated power of the allies. the us navy sent a battleship group to scapa flow to join the grand fleet and provided convoy escorts. in april  the us army had fewer than  men including national guard units compared to british and french armies of . and .million respectively. the selective service act of  drafted .million men though training and equipping such numbers was a huge logistical challenge. by june  over  members of the american expeditionary forces aef were transported to france a figure which reached  million by the end of november..despite his conviction that germany must be defeated wilson went to war to ensure the us played a leading role in shaping the peace which meant preserving the aef as a separate military force rather than being absorbed into british or french units as his allies wanted. he was strongly supported by aef commander general john j. pershing a proponent of pre open warfare who considered the french and british emphasis on artillery misguided and incompatible with american offensive spirit. much to the frustration of his allies who had suffered heavy losses in  he insisted on retaining control of american troops and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units. as a result the first significant us involvement was the meuseargonne offensive in late september ..in december  robert nivelle replaced ptain as commander of french armies on the western front and began planning a spring attack in champagne part of a joint francobritish operation. poor security meant german intelligence was well informed on tactics and timetables but despite this when the attack began on  april the french made substantial gains before being brought to a halt by the newly built and extremely strong defences of the hindenburg line. nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and by  april the french had suffered nearly  casualties including  dead most incurred in the first two days..concurrent british attacks at arras were more successful though ultimately of little strategic value. operating as a separate unit for the first time the canadian corps capture of vimy ridge is viewed by many canadians as a defining moment in creating a sense of national identity. though nivelle continued the offensive on  may the st division which had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting at verdun refused orders to go into battle initiating the french army mutinies within days collective indiscipline had spread to  divisions while over  deserted..in march and april  at the first and second battles of gaza german and ottoman forces stopped the advance of the egyptian expeditionary force which had begun in august  at the battle of romani. at the end of october  the sinai and palestine campaign resumed when general edmund allenbys xxth corps xxi corps and desert mounted corps won the battle of beersheba. two ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the battle of mughar ridge and early in december jerusalem had been captured following another ottoman defeat at the battle of jerusalem..about this time friedrich freiherr kress von kressenstein was relieved of his duties as the eighth armys commander replaced by djevad pasha and a few months later the commander of the ottoman army in palestine erich von falkenhayn was replaced by otto liman von sanders..in early  the front line was extended and the jordan valley was occupied following the first transjordan and the second transjordan attacks by british empire forces in march and april ..in december  the central powers signed an armistice with russia thus freeing large numbers of german troops for use in the west. with german reinforcements and new american troops pouring in the outcome was to be decided on the western front. the central powers knew that they could not win a protracted war but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive. ludendorff drew up plans operation michael for the  offensive on the western front. the operation commenced on  march  with an attack on british forces near saintquentin. german forces achieved an unprecedented advance of  kilometres mi. the initial offensive was a success after heavy fighting however the offensive was halted. lacking tanks or motorised artillery the germans were unable to consolidate their gains. the problems of resupply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shelltorn and often impassable to traffic.germany launched operation georgette against the northern english channel ports. the allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by germany. the german army to the south then conducted operations blcher and yorck pushing broadly towards paris. germany launched operation marne second battle of the marne on  july in an attempt to encircle reims. the resulting counterattack which started the hundred days offensive on  august led to a marked collapse in german morale..by september the germans had fallen back to the hindenburg line. the allies had advanced to the hindenburg line in the north and centre. german forces launched numerous counterattacks but positions and outposts of the line continued falling with the bef alone taking prisoners in the last week of september. on  september the supreme army command informed the leaders in berlin that armistice talks were inevitable..the final assault on the hindenburg line began with the meuseargonne offensive launched by american and french troops on  september. two days later the belgians french and british attacked around ypres and the day after the british at st quentin in the centre of the line. the following week cooperating american and french units broke through in champagne at the battle of blanc mont ridge   october forcing the germans off the commanding heights and closing towards the belgian frontier. on october the hindenburg line was pierced by british and dominion troops of the first and third british armies at the second battle of cambrai..allied forces started the vardar offensive on  september at two key points dobro pole and near dojran lake. in the battle of dobro pole the serbian and french armies had success after a threedaylong battle with relatively small casualties and subsequently made a breakthrough in the front something which was rarely seen in world war i. after the front was broken allied forces started to liberate serbia and reached skopje at  september after which bulgaria signed an armistice with the allies on  september..the collapse of the central powers came swiftly. bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice the armistice of salonica on  september . wilhelm ii in a telegram to tsar ferdinand i of bulgaria described the situation thus disgraceful  serbs decided the war. on the same day the german supreme army command informed wilhelm ii and the imperial chancellor count georg von hertling that the military situation facing germany was hopeless..on  october the italians began a push that rapidly recovered territory lost after the battle of caporetto. this culminated in the battle of vittorio veneto marking the end of the austrohungarian army as an effective fighting force. the offensive also triggered the disintegration of the austrohungarian empire. during the last week of october declarations of independence were made in budapest prague and zagreb. on  october the imperial authorities asked italy for an armistice but the italians continued advancing reaching trento udine and trieste. on november austriahungary sent a flag of truce and accepted the armistice of villa giusti arranged with the allied authorities in paris. austria and hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the habsburg monarchy. in the following days the italian army occupied innsbruck and all tyrol with over  soldiers. on  october the ottoman empire capitulated and signed the armistice of mudros..with the military faltering and with widespread loss of confidence in the kaiser germany moved towards surrender. prince maximilian of baden took charge on  october as chancellor of germany. negotiations with president wilson began immediately in the hope that he would offer better terms than the british and french. wilson demanded a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary control over the german military..the german revolution of  began at the end of october . units of the german navy refused to set sail for a largescale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost. the sailors revolt which then ensued in the naval ports of wilhelmshaven and kiel spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on november  shortly thereafter to the abdication of wilhelm ii and german surrender..in the aftermath of the war the german austrohungarian ottoman and russian empires disappeared. numerous nations regained their former independence and new ones were created. four dynasties fell as a result of the war the romanovs the hohenzollerns the habsburgs and the ottomans. belgium and serbia were badly damaged as was france with . million soldiers dead not counting other casualties. germany and russia were similarly affected..a formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months until the signing of the treaty of versailles with germany on  june . the us senate did not ratify the treaty despite public support for itand did not formally end its involvement in the war until the knoxporter resolution was signed on july  by president warren g. harding. for the british empire the state of war ceased under the provisions of the termination of the present war definition act  concerning.some war memorials date the end of the war as being when the versailles treaty was signed in  which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home by contrast most commemorations of the wars end concentrate on the armistice of  november ..the paris peace conference imposed a series of peace treaties on the central powers officially ending the war. the  treaty of versailles dealt with germany and building on wilsons th point established the league of nations on  june ..the central powers had to acknowledge responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by their aggression. in the treaty of versailles this statement was article . this article became known as the war guilt clause as the majority of germans felt humiliated and resentful. the germans felt they had been unjustly dealt with by what they called the diktat of versailles. german historian hagen schulze said the treaty placed germany under legal sanctions deprived of military power economically ruined and politically humiliated. belgian historian laurence van ypersele emphasises the central role played by memory of the war and the versailles treaty in german politics in the s and s.active denial of war guilt in germany and german resentment at both reparations and continued allied occupation of the rhineland made widespread revision of the meaning and memory of the war problematic. the legend of the stab in the back and the wish to revise the versailles diktat and the belief in an international threat aimed at the elimination of the german nation persisted at the heart of german politics. even a man of peace such as  stresemann publicly rejected german guilt. as for the nazis they waved the banners of domestic treason and international conspiracy in an attempt to galvanise the german nation into a spirit of revenge. like a fascist italy nazi germany sought to redirect the memory of the war to the benefit of its policies..meanwhile new nations liberated from german rule viewed the treaty as a recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by much larger aggressive neighbours..austriahungary was partitioned into several successor states largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. apart from austria and hungary czechoslovakia italy poland romania and yugoslavia received territories from the dual monarchy the formerly separate and autonomous kingdom of croatiaslavonia was incorporated into yugoslavia. the details were contained in the treaties of saintgermainenlaye and trianon. as a result hungary lost  of its total population decreasing from . million to . million and losing  . out of .million of its ethnic hungarians. according to the  census speakers of the hungarian language included approximately  of the entire population of the kingdom of hungary. within the country numerous ethnic minorities were present . romanians . slovaks . germans . ruthenians . serbs and  others. between  and   hungarians fled former hungarian territories attached to romania czechoslovakia and yugoslavia..the russian empire lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of estonia finland latvia lithuania and poland were carved from it. romania took control of bessarabia in april ..after  years poland reemerged as an independent country. the kingdom of serbia and its dynasty as a minor entente nation and the country with the most casualties per capita became the backbone of a new multinational state the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later renamed yugoslavia. czechoslovakia combining the kingdom of bohemia with parts of the kingdom of hungary became a new nation. romania would unite all romanianspeaking people under a single state leading to greater romania..in australia and new zealand the battle of gallipoli became known as those nations baptism of fire. it was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought and it was one of the first times that australian troops fought as australians not just subjects of the british crown and independent national identities for these nations took hold. anzac day named after the australian and new zealand army corps anzac commemorates this defining moment..in the aftermath of world war i greece fought against turkish nationalists led by mustafa kemal a war that eventually resulted in a massive population exchange between the two countries under the treaty of lausanne. according to various sources several hundred thousand greeks died during this period which was tied in with the greek genocide..the total number of military and civilian casualties in world war i was about million estimates range from around  to million deaths and about million wounded military personnel ranking it among the deadliest conflicts in human history. the total number of deaths includes between  and million military personnel with an estimated civilian death toll of about  to million..of the million european military personnel who were mobilised from  to  an estimated million were killed million were permanently disabled and million were seriously injured. germany lost . of its active male population austriahungary lost . and france lost .. france mobilised .million men of which .million died and .million were injured. approximately  deployed men sustained gruesome facial injuries causing social stigma and marginalisation they were called the gueules casses broken faces. in germany civilian deaths were  higher than in peacetime due in large part to food shortages and malnutrition that had weakened disease resistance. these excess deaths are estimated as  in  plus another  in the first half of  when the blockade was still in effect. starvation caused by famine killed approximately  people in lebanon..diseases flourished in the chaotic wartime conditions. in  alone louseborne epidemic typhus killed  in serbia. starting in early  a major influenza epidemic known as spanish flu spread across the world accelerated by the movement of large numbers of soldiers often crammed together in camps and transport ships with poor sanitation. the spanish flu killed at least  to million people including an estimated .million europeans and as many as  americans. between  and  an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica affected nearly million people worldwide..eightmillion equines mostly horses donkeys and mules died threequarters of them from the extreme conditions they worked in..the german army was the first to successfully deploy chemical weapons during the second battle of ypres aprilmay  after german scientists under the direction of fritz haber at the kaiser wilhelm institute developed a method to weaponise chlorine. the use of chemical weapons had been sanctioned by the german high command to force allied soldiers out of their entrenched positions complementing rather than supplanting more lethal conventional weapons. chemical weapons were deployed by all major belligerents throughout the war inflicting approximately .million casualties of which about  were fatal. the use of chemical weapons in warfare was a direct violation of the  hague declaration concerning asphyxiating gases and the  hague convention on land warfare which prohibited their use..the ethnic cleansing of the ottoman empires armenian population including mass deportations and executions during the final years of the ottoman empire is considered genocide. the ottomans carried out organised and systematic massacres of the armenian population at the beginning of the war and manipulated acts of armenian resistance by portraying them as rebellions to justify further extermination. in early  several armenians volunteered to join the russian forces and the ottoman government used this as a pretext to issue the tehcir law law on deportation which authorised the deportation of armenians from the empires eastern provinces to syria between  and . the armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by ottoman brigands. while the exact number of deaths is unknown the international association of genocide scholars estimates around .million. the government of turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day arguing that those who died were victims of interethnic fighting famine or disease during world wari these claims are rejected by most historians..other ethnic groups were similarly attacked by the ottoman empire during this period including assyrians and greeks and some scholars consider those events to be part of the same policy of extermination. at least  assyrian christians about half of the population and  anatolian and pontic greeks were killed between  and ..about million soldiers surrendered and were held in pow camps during the war. all nations pledged to follow the hague conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war and the survival rate for pows was generally much higher than that of combatants at the front..around  of russian losses as a proportion of those captured wounded or killed were to prisoner status for austriahungary  for italy  for france  for germany  for britain . prisoners from the allied armies totalled about .million not including russia which lost ..million soldiers as prisoners. from the central powers about .million soldiers became prisoners most of them surrendered to russians..allied personnel was around  while central personnel was near . british soldiers of the war were initially volunteers but were increasingly conscripted. surviving veterans returning home often found they could discuss their experiences only among themselves so formed veterans associations or legions..conscription was common in most european countries. however it was controversial in englishspeaking countries it was especially unpopular among minority ethnicitiesespecially the irish catholics in ireland australia and the french catholics in canada..in the us conscription began in  and was generally wellreceived with a few pockets of opposition in isolated rural areas. the administration decided to rely primarily on conscription rather than voluntary enlistment to raise military manpower after only  volunteers enlisted out of the initial  million target in the first six weeks of war..military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern embedded positions within the opposing land and naval forces..macro and microeconomic consequences devolved from the war. families were altered by the departure of many men. with the death or absence of the primary wage earner women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. at the same time the industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. this aided the struggle for voting rights for women..in all nations the governments share of gdp increased surpassing  in both germany and france and nearly reaching that level in britain. to pay for purchases in the us britain cashed in its extensive investments in american railroads and then began borrowing heavily from wall street. president wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late  but allowed a great increase in us government lending to the allies. after  the us demanded repayment of these loans. the repayments were in part funded by german reparations that in turn were supported by american loans to germany. this circular system collapsed in  and some loans were never repaid. britain still owed the united states . billion of world wari debt in  the last installment was finally paid in ..britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. geologists such as albert kitson were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the african colonies. kitson discovered important new deposits of manganese used in munitions production in the gold coast..article  of the treaty of versailles the socalled war guilt clause stated germany accepted responsibility for all the loss and damage to which the allied and associated governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of germany and her allies. it was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with austria and hungary. however neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt. in  the total reparation sum was placed at billion gold marks. however allied experts knew that germany could not pay this sum. the total sum was divided into three categories with the third being deliberately designed to be chimerical and its primary function was to mislead public opinion... into believing the total sum was being maintained. thus billion gold marks .billion dollars represented the actual allied assessment of german capacity to pay and therefore... represented the total german reparations figure that had to be paid..this figure could be paid in cash or inkind coal timber chemical dyes etc.. some of the territory lostvia the treaty of versailleswas credited towards the reparation figure as were other acts such as helping to restore the library of louvain. by  the great depression caused political chaos throughout the world. in  the payment of reparations was suspended by the international community by which point germany had paid only the equivalent of .billion gold marks. with the rise of adolf hitler all bonds and loans that had been issued and taken out during the s and early s were cancelled. david andelman notes refusing to pay doesnt make an agreement null and void. the bonds the agreement still exist. thus following the second world war at the london conference in  germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed. on october  germany made the final payment on these bonds..the australian prime minister billy hughes wrote to the british prime minister david lloyd george you have assured us that you cannot get better terms. i much regret it and hope even now that some way may be found of securing agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the british empire and her allies. australia received  in war reparations but the direct cost of the war to australia had been  and by the mids repatriation pensions war gratuities interest and sinking fund charges were ..in the balkans yugoslav nationalists such as the leader ante trumbi strongly supported the war desiring the freedom of yugoslavs from austriahungary and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent yugoslavia. the yugoslav committee led by trumbi was formed in paris on  april  but shortly moved its office to london. in april  the rome congress of oppressed nationalities met including czechoslovak italian polish transylvanian and yugoslav representatives who urged the allies to support national selfdetermination for the peoples residing within austriahungary..in the middle east arab nationalism soared in ottoman territories in response to the rise of turkish nationalism during the war. arab nationalist leaders advocated the creation of a panarab state. in  the arab revolt began in ottomancontrolled territories of the middle east to achieve independence..in east africa iyasu v of ethiopia was supporting the dervish state who were at war with the british in the somaliland campaign. von syburg the german envoy in addis ababa said now the time has come for ethiopia to regain the coast of the red sea driving the italians home to restore the empire to its ancient size. the ethiopian empire was on the verge of entering world wari on the side of the central powers before iyasus overthrow at the battle of segale due to allied pressure on the ethiopian aristocracy..several socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in august . but european socialists split on national lines with the concept of class conflict held by radical socialists such as marxists and syndicalists being overborne by their patriotic support for the war. once the war began austrian british french german and russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries intervention in the war..italian nationalism was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. one of the most prominent and popular italian nationalist supporters of the war was gabriele dannunzio who promoted italian irredentism and helped sway the italian public to support intervention in the war. the italian liberal party under the leadership of paolo boselli promoted intervention in the war on the side of the allies and used the dante alighieri society to promote italian nationalism. italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it some were militant supporters of the war including benito mussolini and leonida bissolati. however the italian socialist party decided to oppose the war after antimilitarist protestors were killed resulting in a general strike called red week. the italian socialist party purged itself of prowar nationalist members including mussolini. mussolini formed the prointerventionist il popolo ditalia and the fasci rivoluzionario dazione internazionalista revolutionary fasci for international action in october  that later developed into the fasci italiani di combattimento in  the origin of fascism. mussolinis nationalism enabled him to raise funds from ansaldo an armaments firm and other companies to create il popolo ditalia to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war..on both sides there was largescale fundraising for soldiers welfare their dependents and those injured. the nail men were a german example. around the british empire there were many patriotic funds including the royal patriotic fund corporation canadian patriotic fund queensland patriotic fund and by  there were  funds in new zealand. at the start of the next world war the new zealand funds were reformed having been criticised as overlapping wasteful and abused but  were still functioning in ..many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. these included eugene debs in the us and bertrand russell in britain. in the us the espionage act of  and sedition act of  made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed disloyal. publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors  and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic..several nationalists opposed intervention particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. although the vast majority of irish people consented to participate in the war in  and  a minority of advanced irish nationalists had staunchly opposed taking part. the war began amid the home rule crisis in ireland that had resurfaced in  and by july  there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in ireland. irish nationalists and marxists attempted to pursue irish independence culminating in the easter rising of  with germany sending  rifles to ireland to stir unrest in britain. the british government placed ireland under martial law in response to the easter rising though once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling. however opposition to involvement in the war increased in ireland resulting in the conscription crisis of ..other opposition came from conscientious objectorssome socialist some religiouswho had refused to fight. in britain  people asked for conscientious objector status. some of them most notably prominent peace activist stephen hobhouse refused both military and alternative service. many suffered years of prison including solitary confinement. even after the war in britain many job advertisements were marked no conscientious objectors need to apply..on  may  about  workers and soldiers of petrograd and after them the workers and soldiers of other russian cities led by the bolsheviks demonstrated under banners reading down with the war and all power to the soviets. the mass demonstrations resulted in a crisis for the russian provisional government. in milan in may  bolshevik revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation. the italian army was forced to enter milan with tanks and machine guns to face bolsheviks and anarchists who fought violently until  may when the army gained control of the city. almost  people including three italian soldiers were killed and over  people were arrested..world war i began as a clash of thcentury technology and thcentury tactics with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. by the end of  however the major armies had modernised and were making use of telephone wireless communication armoured cars tanks especially with the advent of the prototype tank little willie and aircraft..artillery also underwent a revolution. in  cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. by  indirect fire with guns as well as mortars and even machine guns was commonplace using new techniques for spotting and ranging notably aircraft and the field telephone..fixedwing aircraft were initially used for reconnaissance and ground attack. to shoot down enemy planes antiaircraft guns and fighter aircraft were developed. strategic bombers were created principally by the germans and british though the former used zeppelins as well. towards the end of the conflict aircraft carriers were used for the first time with hms furious launching sopwith camels in a raid to destroy the zeppelin hangars at tnder in ..the nonmilitary diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy. for the most part wartime diplomacy focused on five issues propaganda campaigns defining and redefining the war goals which became harsher as the war went on luring neutral nations italy ottoman empire bulgaria romania into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory and encouragement by the allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the central powers especially among czechs poles and arabs. in addition multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals or one side or the other none of them progressed very far..memorials were built in thousands of villages and towns. close to battlefields those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the commonwealth war graves commission the american battle monuments commission the german war graves commission and le souvenir franais. many of these graveyards also have monuments to the missing or unidentified dead such as the menin gate memorial to the missing and the thiepval memorial to the missing of the somme..in  john mccrae a canadian army doctor wrote the poem in flanders fields as a salute to those who perished in the war. it is still recited today especially on remembrance day and memorial day..national world war i museum and memorial in kansas city missouri is a memorial dedicated to all americans who served in world wari. the liberty memorial was dedicated on  november ..the british government budgeted substantial resources to the commemoration of the war during the period  to . the lead body is the imperial war museum. on august  french president franois hollande and german president joachim gauck together marked the centenary of germanys declaration of war on france by laying the first stone of a memorial in vieil armand known in german as hartmannswillerkopf for french and german soldiers killed in the war. as part of commemorations for the centenary of the  armistice french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel visited the site of the signing of the armistice of compigne and unveiled a plaque to reconciliation.....strange friend i said here is no cause to mourn.none said the other save the undone years....the first efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war and are still underway more than a century later. teaching world war i has presented special challenges. when compared with world war ii the first world war is often thought to be a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterises retellings of the second world war. lacking recognizable heroes and villains it is often taught thematically invoking simplified tropes that obscure the complexity of the conflict..historian heather jones argues that the historiography has been reinvigorated by a cultural turn in the st century. scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation radicalisation of politics race medical science gender and mental health. among the major subjects that historians have long debated regarding the war include why the war began why the allies won whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates how soldiers endured the poor conditions of trench warfare and to what extent the civilian home front accepted and endorsed the war effort..as late as  unexploded ordnance at battlefield sites like verdun and somme continued to pose a danger. in france and belgium locals who discover caches of unexploded munitions are assisted by weapons disposal units. in some places plant life has still not recovered from the effects of

coalitions the allies and the axis powers. nearly all of the worlds countries participated with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of total war. tanks and aircraft played major roles enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. world war ii was the deadliest conflict in history causing the death of  to  million people more than half of whom were civilians. millions died in genocides including the holocaust and by massacres starvation and disease. after the allied victory germany austria japan and korea were occupied and german and japanese leaders were tried for war crimes..the causes of world war ii included unresolved tensions in the aftermath of world war i and the rises of fascism in europe and militarism in japan. key events preceding the war included japans invasion of manchuria in  the spanish civil war the outbreak of the second sinojapanese war in  and germanys annexations of austria and the sudetenland. world warii is generally considered to have begun on  september  when nazi germany under adolf hitler invaded poland after which the united kingdom and france declared war on germany. poland was divided between germany and the soviet union under the molotovribbentrop pact. in  the soviet union annexed the baltic states and parts of finland and romania. after the fall of france in june  the war continued mainly between germany and the british empire with fighting in the balkans mediterranean and middle east the aerial battle of britain and the blitz and the naval battle of the atlantic. through campaigns and treaties germany gained control of much of continental europe and formed the axis alliance with italy japan and other countries. in june  germany invaded the soviet union opening the eastern front and initially making large territorial gains..in december  japan attacked american and british territories in asia and the pacific including at pearl harbor in hawaii leading the united states to enter the war against japan and germany. japan conquered much of coastal china and southeast asia but its advances in the pacific were halted in june  at the battle of midway. in early  axis forces were defeated in north africa and at stalingrad in the soviet union and that year their continued defeats on the eastern front an allied invasion of italy and allied offensives in the pacific forced them into retreat on all fronts. in  the western allies invaded france at normandy as the soviet union recaptured its prewar territory and the us crippled japans navy and captured key pacific islands. the war in europe concluded with the liberation of germanoccupied territories invasions of germany by the western allies and the soviet union which culminated in the fall of berlin to soviet troops and germanys unconditional surrender on  may . on  and  august the us dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in japan. faced with an imminent allied invasion the prospect of further atomic bombings and a soviet declaration of war and invasion of manchuria japan announced its unconditional surrender on  august and signed a surrender document on  september ..world warii transformed the political economic and social structures of the world and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the th century and into the st century. the united nations was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts with the victorious great powerschina france the soviet union the uk and the usbecoming the permanent members of its security council. the soviet union and us emerged as rival global superpowers setting the stage for the halfcentury cold war. in the wake of europes devastation the influence of its great powers waned triggering the decolonisation of africa and asia. many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion..most historians date the beginning of world war ii to the german invasion of poland on  september  and the united kingdom and frances declaration of war on germany two days later. dates for the beginning of the pacific war include the start of the second sinojapanese war on  july  or the earlier japanese invasion of manchuria on  september . others follow the british historian a. j. p. taylor who stated that the sinojapanese war and war in europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars became world war ii in . other proposed starting dates for world warii include the italian invasion of abyssinia on  october . the british historian antony beevor views the beginning of world warii as the battles of khalkhin gol fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september . others view the spanish civil war as the start or prelude to world war ii..the exact date of the wars end also is not universally agreed upon. it was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of  august  vj day rather than with the formal surrender of japan on  september  which officially ended the war in asia. a peace treaty between japan and the allies was signed in . a  treaty regarding germanys future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place. no formal peace treaty between japan and the soviet union was ever signed although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the sovietjapanese joint declaration of  which also restored full diplomatic relations between them..world war i had radically altered the political european map with the defeat of the central powersincluding austriahungary germany bulgaria and the ottoman empireand the  bolshevik seizure of power in russia which led to the founding of the soviet union. meanwhile the victorious allies of world war i such as france belgium italy romania and greece gained territory and new nationstates were created out of the dissolution of the austrohungarian ottoman and russian empires..to prevent a future world war the league of nations was established in  by the paris peace conference. the organisations primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security military and naval disarmament as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration..despite strong pacifist sentiment after world wari irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several european states. these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial colonial and financial losses imposed by the treaty of versailles. under the treaty germany lost around  percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions while german annexation of other states was prohibited reparations were imposed and limits were placed on the size and capability of the countrys armed forces..the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of  and a democratic government later known as the weimar republic was created. the interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left. italy as an entente ally had made some postwar territorial gains however italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the united kingdom and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. from  to  the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist totalitarian and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy repressed socialist leftwing and liberal forces and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power promising the creation of a new roman empire..adolf hitler after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in  eventually became the chancellor of germany in  when president paul von hindenburg and the reichstag appointed him. following hindenburgs death in  hitler proclaimed himself fhrer of germany and abolished democracy espousing a radical racially motivated revision of the world order and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. france seeking to secure its alliance with italy allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia which italy desired as a colonial possession. the situation was aggravated in early  when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced conscription..the united kingdom france and italy formed the stresa front in april  in order to contain germany a key step towards military globalisation however that june the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany easing prior restrictions. the soviet union concerned by germanys goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france. before taking effect though the francosoviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations which rendered it essentially toothless. the united states concerned with events in europe and asia passed the neutrality act in august of the same year..hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march  encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement. in october  germany and italy formed the romeberlin axis. a month later germany and japan signed the anticomintern pact which italy joined the following year..the kuomintang party in china launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified china in the mids but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former chinese communist party ccp allies and new regional warlords. in  an increasingly militaristic empire of japan which had long sought influence in china as the first step of what its government saw as the countrys right to rule asia staged the mukden incident as a pretext to invade manchuria and establish the puppet state of manchukuo..china appealed to the league of nations to stop the japanese invasion of manchuria. japan withdrew from the league of nations after being condemned for its incursion into manchuria. the two nations then fought several battles in shanghai rehe and hebei until the tanggu truce was signed in . thereafter chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to japanese aggression in manchuria and chahar and suiyuan. after the  xian incident the kuomintang and ccp forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose japan..the second italoethiopian war was a brief colonial war that began in october  and ended in may . the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire also known as abyssinia by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy regno ditalia which was launched from italian somaliland and eritrea. the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa africa orientale italiana in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace. both italy and ethiopia were member nations but the league did little when the former clearly violated article x of the leagues covenant. the united kingdom and france supported imposing sanctions on italy for the invasion but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the italian invasion. italy subsequently dropped its objections to germanys goal of absorbing austria..when civil war broke out in spain hitler and mussolini lent military support to the nationalist rebels led by general francisco franco. italy supported the nationalists to a greater extent than the nazis mussolini sent more than  ground troops  aviation personnel and  aircraft to spain. the soviet union supported the existing government of the spanish republic. more than  foreign volunteers known as the international brigades also fought against the nationalists. both germany and the soviet union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. the nationalists won the civil war in april  franco now dictator remained officially neutral during world warii but generally favoured the axis. his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front..in july  japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after instigating the marco polo bridge incident which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china. the soviets quickly signed a nonaggression pact with china to lend materiel support effectively ending chinas prior cooperation with germany. from september to november the japanese attacked taiyuan engaged the kuomintang army around xinkou and fought communist forces in pingxingguan. generalissimo chiang kaishek deployed his best army to defend shanghai but after three months of fighting shanghai fell. the japanese continued to push chinese forces back capturing the capital nanking in december . after the fall of nanking tens or hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the japanese..in march  nationalist chinese forces won their first major victory at taierzhuang but then the city of xuzhou was taken by the japanese in may. in june  chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river this manoeuvre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wuhan but the city was taken by october. japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve instead the chinese government relocated inland to chongqing and continued the war..in the midtolate s japanese forces in manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and mongolia. the japanese doctrine of hokushinron which emphasised japans expansion northward was favoured by the imperial army during this time. this policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the japanese defeat at khalkin gol in  the ongoing second sinojapanese war and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets. japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april  and japan adopted the doctrine of nanshinron promoted by the navy which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the united states and the western allies..in europe germany and italy were becoming more aggressive. in march  germany annexed austria again provoking little response from other european powers. encouraged hitler began pressing german claims on the sudetenland an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population. soon the united kingdom and france followed the appeasement policy of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands. soon afterwards germany and italy forced czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to hungary and poland annexed the transolza region of czechoslovakia..although all of germanys stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation. in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish warmongers and in january  secretly ordered a major buildup of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy. in march  germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and moravia and a progerman client state the slovak republic. hitler also delivered an ultimatum to lithuania on  march  forcing the concession of the klaipda region formerly the german memelland..greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig the united kingdom and france guaranteed their support for polish independence when italy conquered albania in april  the same guarantee was extended to the kingdoms of romania and greece. shortly after the francobritish pledge to poland germany and italy formalised their own alliance with the pact of steel. hitler accused the united kingdom and poland of trying to encircle germany and renounced the anglogerman naval agreement and the germanpolish declaration of nonaggression..the situation became a crisis in late august as german troops continued to mobilise against the polish border. on  august the soviet union signed a nonaggression pact with germany after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between france the united kingdom and soviet union had stalled. this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet spheres of influence western poland and lithuania for germany eastern poland finland estonia latvia and bessarabia for the soviet union and raised the question of continuing polish independence. the pact neutralised the possibility of soviet opposition to a campaign against poland and assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a twofront war as it had in world wari. immediately afterwards hitler ordered the attack to proceed on  august but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality he decided to delay it..in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war germany made demands on poland which served as a pretext to worsen relations. on  august hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession. the poles refused to comply with the german demands and on the night of  august in a confrontational meeting with the british ambassador nevile henderson ribbentrop declared that germany considered its claims rejected..on  september  germany invaded poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion. the first german attack of the war came against the polish defences at westerplatte. the united kingdom responded with an ultimatum for germany to cease military operations and on  september after the ultimatum was ignored britain and france declared war on germany. during the phoney war period the alliance provided no direct military support to poland outside of a cautious french probe into the saarland. the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany which aimed to damage the countrys economy and war effort. germany responded by ordering uboat warfare against allied merchant and warships which would later escalate into the battle of the atlantic.on  september german troops reached the suburbs of warsaw. the polish counteroffensive to the west halted the german advance for several days but it was outflanked and encircled by the wehrmacht. remnants of the polish army broke through to besieged warsaw. on  september  two days after signing a ceasefire with japan the soviet union invaded poland under the supposed pretext that the polish state had ceased to exist. on  september the warsaw garrison surrendered to the germans and the last large operational unit of the polish army surrendered on october. despite the military defeat poland never surrendered instead it formed the polish governmentinexile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied poland. a significant part of polish military personnel evacuated to romania and latvia many of them later fought against the axis in other theatres of the war..germany annexed western poland and occupied central poland the soviet union annexed eastern poland small shares of polish territory were transferred to lithuania and slovakia. on  october hitler made a public peace overture to the united kingdom and france but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union. the proposal was rejected and hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france which was postponed until the spring of  due to bad weather..after the outbreak of war in poland stalin threatened estonia latvia and lithuania with military invasion forcing the three baltic countries to sign pacts allowing the creation of soviet military bases in these countries in october  significant soviet military contingents were moved there. finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the soviet union. the soviet union invaded finland in november  and was subsequently expelled from the league of nations for this crime of aggression. despite overwhelming numerical superiority soviet military success during the winter war was modest and the finnosoviet war ended in march  with some finnish concessions of territory..in june  the soviet union occupied the entire territories of estonia latvia and lithuania as well as the romanian regions of bessarabia northern bukovina and the hertsa region. in august  hitler imposed the second vienna award on romania which led to the transfer of northern transylvania to hungary. in september  bulgaria demanded southern dobruja from romania with german and italian support leading to the treaty of craiova. the loss of onethird of romanias  territory caused a coup against king carol ii turning romania into a fascist dictatorship under marshal ion antonescu with a course set towards the axis in the hopes of a german guarantee. meanwhile germansoviet political relations and economic cooperation gradually stalled and both states began preparations for war..in april  germany invaded denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden which the allies were attempting to cut off. denmark capitulated after six hours and despite allied support norway was conquered within two months. british discontent over the norwegian campaign led to the resignation of prime minister neville chamberlain who was replaced by winston churchill on may ..on the same day germany launched an offensive against france. to circumvent the strong maginot line fortifications on the francogerman border germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of belgium the netherlands and luxembourg. the germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the ardennes region which was mistakenly perceived by the allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles. by successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics the wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the channel and cut off the allied forces in belgium trapping the bulk of the allied armies in a cauldron on the francobelgian border near lille. the united kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of allied troops from the continent by early june although they had to abandon almost all their equipment..on  june italy invaded france declaring war on both france and the united kingdom. the germans turned south against the weakened french army and paris fell to them on june. eight days later france signed an armistice with germany it was divided into german and italian occupation zones and an unoccupied rump state under the vichy regime which though officially neutral was generally aligned with germany. france kept its fleet which the united kingdom attacked on july in an attempt to prevent its seizure by germany..the air battle of britain began in early july with luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours. the german campaign for air superiority started in august but its failure to defeat raf fighter command forced the indefinite postponement of the proposed german invasion of britain. the german strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz but largely ended in may  after failing to significantly disrupt the british war effort..using newly captured french ports the german navy enjoyed success against an overextended royal navy using uboats against british shipping in the atlantic. the british home fleet scored a significant victory on may  by sinking the german battleship bismarck..in november  the united states was assisting china and the western allies and had amended the neutrality act to allow cash and carry purchases by the allies. in  following the german capture of paris the size of the united states navy was significantly increased. in september the united states further agreed to a trade of american destroyers for british bases. still a large majority of the american public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into . in december  roosevelt accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless calling for the united states to become an arsenal of democracy and promoting lendlease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the british war effort lendlease was later extended to the other allies including the soviet union after it was invaded by germany. the united states started strategic planning to prepare for a fullscale offensive against germany..at the end of september  the tripartite pact formally united japan italy and germany as the axis powers. the tripartite pact stipulated that any countrywith the exception of the soviet unionthat attacked any axis power would be forced to go to war against all three. the axis expanded in november  when hungary slovakia and romania joined. romania and hungary later made major contributions to the axis war against the soviet union in romanias case partially to recapture territory ceded to the soviet union..in early june  the italian regia aeronautica attacked and besieged malta a british possession. from late summer to early autumn italy conquered british somaliland and made an incursion into britishheld egypt. in october italy attacked greece but the attack was repulsed with heavy italian casualties the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes. to assist italy and prevent britain from gaining a foothold germany prepared to invade the balkans which would threaten romanian oil fields and strike against british dominance of the mediterranean..in december  british empire forces began counteroffensives against italian forces in egypt and italian east africa. the offensives were successful by early february  italy had lost control of eastern libya and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner. the italian navy also suffered significant defeats with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at taranto and neutralising several more warships at the battle of cape matapan..italian defeats prompted germany to deploy an expeditionary force to north africa at the end of march  rommels afrika korps launched an offensive which drove back commonwealth forces. in less than a month axis forces advanced to western egypt and besieged the port of tobruk..by late march  bulgaria and yugoslavia signed the tripartite pact however the yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by probritish nationalists. germany and italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both yugoslavia and greece commencing on  april  both nations were forced to surrender within the month. the airborne invasion of the greek island of crete at the end of may completed the german conquest of the balkans. partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the axis occupation of yugoslavia which continued until the end of the war..in the middle east in may commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichycontrolled syria. between june and july britishled forces invaded and occupied the french possessions of syria and lebanon assisted by the free french..with the situation in europe and asia relatively stable germany japan and the soviet union made preparations for war. with the soviets wary of mounting tensions with germany and the japanese planning to take advantage of the european war by seizing resourcerich european possessions in southeast asia the two powers signed the sovietjapanese neutrality pact in april . by contrast the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union massing forces on the soviet border..hitler believed that the united kingdoms refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany sooner or later. on  july  hitler decided that the soviet union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of ukraine the baltic states and byelorussia. however other senior german officials like ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a euroasian bloc against the british empire by inviting the soviet union into the tripartite pact. in november  negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the pact. the soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from finland bulgaria turkey and japan that germany considered unacceptable. on  december  hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the soviet union..on  june  germany supported by italy and romania invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa with germany accusing the soviets of plotting against them they were joined shortly by finland and hungary. the primary targets of this surprise offensive were the baltic region moscow and ukraine with the ultimate goal of ending the  campaign near the arkhangelskastrakhan linefrom the caspian to the white seas. hitlers objectives were to eliminate the soviet union as a military power exterminate communism generate lebensraum living space by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat germanys remaining rivals..although the red army was preparing for strategic counteroffensives before the war operation barbarossa forced the soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence. during the summer the axis made significant gains into soviet territory inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. by midaugust however the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre and to divert the nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad. the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies and made possible further advance into crimea and industriallydeveloped eastern ukraine the first battle of kharkov..the diversion of threequarters of the axis troops and the majority of their air forces from france and the central mediterranean to the eastern front prompted the united kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy. in july the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany and in august the united kingdom and the united states jointly issued the atlantic charter which outlined british and american goals for the postwar world. in late august the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor irans oil fields and preempt any axis advances through iran toward the baku oil fields or india..by october axis powers had achieved operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region with only the sieges of leningrad and sevastopol continuing. a major offensive against moscow was renewed after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the german army almost reached the outer suburbs of moscow where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend the offensive. large territorial gains were made by axis forces but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives two key cities remained in soviet hands the soviet capability to resist was not broken and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential. the blitzkrieg phase of the war in europe had ended..by early december freshly mobilised reserves allowed the soviets to achieve numerical parity with axis troops. this as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwantung army allowed the soviets to begin a massive counteroffensive that started on  december all along the front and pushed german troops  kilometres mi west..following the japanese false flag mukden incident in  the japanese shelling of the american gunboat uss panay in  and the  nanjing massacre japaneseamerican relations deteriorated. in  the united states notified japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and american public opinion opposing japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctionsthe export control actswhich banned us exports of chemicals minerals and military parts to japan and increased economic pressure on the japanese regime. during  japan launched its first attack against changsha but was repulsed by late september. despite several offensives by both sides by  the war between china and japan was at a stalemate. to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers japan invaded and occupied northern indochina in september ..chinese nationalist forces launched a largescale counteroffensive in early . in august chinese communists launched an offensive in central china in retaliation japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january  effectively ending their cooperation. in march the japanese th army attacked the headquarters of the chinese th army but was repulsed during the battle of shanggao. in september japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces..german successes in europe prompted japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia. the dutch government agreed to provide japan with oil supplies from the dutch east indies but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june . in july  japan sent troops to southern indochina thus threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east. the united states the united kingdom and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo. at the same time japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east intending to take advantage of the german invasion in the west but abandoned the operation after the sanctions..since early  the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china. during these negotiations japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate. at the same time the united states the united kingdom and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories in the event of a japanese attack against any of them. roosevelt reinforced the philippines an american protectorate scheduled for independence in  and warned japan that the united states would react to japanese attacks against any neighboring countries..frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the americanbritishdutch sanctions japan prepared for war. emperor hirohito after initial hesitation about japans chances of victory began to favour japans entry into the war. as a result prime minister fumimaro konoe resigned. hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint prince naruhiko higashikuni in his place choosing war minister hideki tojo instead. on  november nagano explained in detail the plan of the attack on pearl harbor to the emperor. on  november hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war. on  november the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to japan. in exchange japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina. the american counterproposal of  november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude nonaggression pacts with all pacific powers. that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force the japanese military did not consider the former an option and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war..japan planned to seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific. the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the overstretched allies by fighting a defensive war. to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset. on  december   december in asian time zones japan attacked british and american holdings with nearsimultaneous offensives against southeast asia and the central pacific. these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines as well as invasions of guam wake island malaya thailand and hong kong..these attacks led the united states united kingdom china australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan whereas the soviet union being heavily involved in largescale hostilities with european axis countries maintained its neutrality agreement with japan. germany followed by the other axis states declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt..on  january  the allied big fourthe soviet union china the united kingdom and the united statesand  smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations thereby affirming the atlantic charter and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers..during  allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective. the americans favoured a straightforward largescale attack on germany through france. the soviets demanded a second front. the british argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength leading to increasing demoralisation and bolstering resistance forces germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using largescale armies. eventually the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in  and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa..at the casablanca conference in early  the allies reiterated the statements issued in the  declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes. although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war in may  the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in ..by the end of april  japan and its ally thailand had almost conquered burma malaya the dutch east indies singapore and rabaul inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may  forcing its government into exile. on  april in burma  british soldiers were encircled by the japanese rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese th division. japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the south china sea java sea and indian ocean and bombed the allied naval base at darwin australia. in january  the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha. these easy victories over the unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident and overextended..in early may  japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia. the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force centred on two american fleet carriers fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea. japans next plan motivated by the earlier doolittle raid was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated as a diversion japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska. in midmay japan started the zhejiangjiangxi campaign in china with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying chinese air bases and fighting against the chinese rd and nd army groups. in early june japan put its operations into action but the americans had broken japanese naval codes in late may and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy..with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle japan attempted to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua. the americans planned a counterattack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands primarily guadalcanal as a first step towards capturing rabaul the main japanese base in southeast asia..both plans started in july but by midseptember the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of bunagona. guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for guadalcanal. by the start of  the japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops. in burma commonwealth forces mounted two operations. the first was a disastrous offensive into the arakan region in late  that forced a retreat back to india by may . the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese frontlines in february which by the end of april had achieved mixed results..despite considerable losses in early  germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. in may the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov and then in june  launched their main summer offensive against southern russia to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy the kuban steppe while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. the germans split army group south into two groups army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck southeast to the caucasus while army group b headed towards the volga river. the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga..by midnovember the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting. the soviets began their second winter counteroffensive starting with an encirclement of german forces at stalingrad and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow though the latter failed disastrously. by early february  the german army had taken tremendous losses german troops at stalingrad had been defeated and the frontline had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. in midfebruary after the soviet push had tapered off the germans launched another attack on kharkov creating a salient in their front line around the soviet city of kursk..exploiting poor american naval command decisions the german navy ravaged allied shipping off the american atlantic coast. by november  commonwealth forces had launched a counteroffensive in north africa operation crusader and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made. the germans also launched a north african offensive in january pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. concerns that the japanese might use bases in vichyheld madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may . an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein. on the continent raids of allied commandos on strategic targets culminating in the failed dieppe raid demonstrated the western allies inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation equipment and operational security..in august  the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein and at a high cost managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta. a few months later the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya. this attack was followed up shortly after by angloamerican landings in french north africa which resulted in the region joining the allies. hitler responded to the french colonys defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces. axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia which was conquered by the allies in may ..in june  the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy reduce morale and dehouse the civilian population. the firebombing of hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre..after the guadalcanal campaign the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific. in may  canadian and us forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians. soon after the united states with support from australia new zealand and pacific islander forces began major ground sea and air operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands. by the end of march  the allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands. in april the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea..in the soviet union both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of  preparing for large offensives in central russia. on  july  germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge. within a week german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets wellconstructed defences and for the first time in the war hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. this decision was partially affected by the western allies invasion of sicily launched on  july which combined with previous italian failures resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month..on  july  the soviets launched their own counteroffensives thereby dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east. the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front. the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified pantherwotan line but the soviets broke through it at smolensk and the lower dnieper offensive..on  september  the western allies invaded the italian mainland following italys armistice with the allies and the ensuing german occupation of italy. germany with the help of fascists responded to the armistice by disarming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders seizing military control of italian areas and creating a series of defensive lines. german special forces then rescued mussolini who then soon established a new client state in germanoccupied italy named the italian social republic causing an italian civil war. the western allies fought through several lines until reaching the main german defensive line in midnovember..german operations in the atlantic also suffered. by may  as allied countermeasures became increasingly effective the resulting sizeable german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign. in november  franklin d. roosevelt and winston churchill met with chiang kaishek in cairo and then with joseph stalin in tehran. the former conference determined the postwar return of japanese territory and the military planning for the burma campaign while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in  and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germanys defeat..from november  during the sevenweek battle of changde the chinese awaited allied relief as they forced japan to fight a costly war of attrition. in january  the allies launched a series of attacks in italy against the line at monte cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at anzio..on  january  soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region thereby ending the most lethal siege in history. the following soviet offensive was halted on the prewar estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to reestablish national independence. this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region. by late may  the soviets had liberated crimea largely expelled axis forces from ukraine and made incursions into romania which were repulsed by the axis troops. the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat rome was captured on  june..the allies had mixed success in mainland asia. in march  the japanese launched the first of two invasions an operation against allied positions in assam india and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima. in may  british and indian forces mounted a counteroffensive that drove japanese troops back to burma by july and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late  besieged japanese troops in myitkyina. the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy chinas main fighting forces secure railways between japaneseheld territory and capture allied airfields. by june the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha..on  june  commonly known as dday after three years of soviet pressure the western allies invaded northern france. after reassigning several allied divisions from italy they also attacked southern france. these landings were successful and led to the defeat of the german army units in france. paris was liberated on  august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces both led by general charles de gaulle and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year. an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed. after that the western allies slowly pushed into germany but failed to cross the ruhr river. in italy the allied advance slowed due to the last major german defensive line..on  june the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus operation bagration that nearly destroyed the german army group centre. soon after that another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland. the soviets formed the polish committee of national liberation to control territory in poland and combat the polish armia krajowa the soviet red army remained in the praga district on the other side of the vistula and watched passively as the germans quelled the warsaw uprising initiated by the armia krajowa. the national uprising in slovakia was also quelled by the germans. the soviet red armys strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup dtat in romania and in bulgaria followed by those countries shift to the allied side..in september  soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off. by this point the communistled partisans under marshal josip broz tito who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since  controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south. in northern serbia the soviet red army with limited support from bulgarian forces assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on  october. a few days later the soviets launched a massive assault against germanoccupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february . unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a sovietfinnish armistice on relatively mild conditions although finland was forced to fight their former german allies..by the start of july  commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river while the chinese captured myitkyina. in september  chinese forces captured mount song and reopened the burma

push back the japanese perimeter. in midjune  they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea. these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister hideki tojo and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands. in late october american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte soon after allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf one of the largest naval battles in history..on  december  germany made a last attempt to split the allies on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counteroffensive in the ardennes and along the frenchgerman border hoping to encircle large portions of western allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at antwerp. by  january  this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. in italy the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line. in midjanuary  the red army attacked in poland pushing from the vistula to the

chinese forces defeated the japanese in northern burma in march and the british pushed on to reach rangoon by  may. chinese forces started a counterattack in the battle of west hunan that occurred between  april and  june . american naval and amphibious forces also moved towards japan taking iwo jima by march and okinawa by the end of june. at the same time a naval blockade by submarines was strangling japans economy and drastically reducing its ability to supply overseas forces..on  july allied leaders met in potsdam germany. they confirmed earlier agreements about germany and the american british and chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of japan specifically stating that the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction. during this conference the united kingdom held its general election and clement attlee replaced churchill as prime minister..the call for unconditional surrender was rejected by the japanese government which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms. in early august the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki. between the two bombings the soviets pursuant to the yalta agreement declared war on japan invaded japaneseheld manchuria and quickly defeated the kwantung army which was the largest japanese fighting force. these two events persuaded previously adamant imperial army leaders to accept surrender terms. the red army also captured the southern part of sakhalin island and the kuril islands. on the night of  august  emperor hirohito announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the allies in the potsdam declaration. on  august the emperor communicated this decision to the japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio gyokuonhs literally broadcast in the emperors voice. on  august  japan surrendered with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship ussmissouri on  september  ending the war..the allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union respectively. however their paths soon diverged. in germany the western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union officially ended in  with the respective zones becoming separate countries west germany and east germany. in austria however occupation continued until  when a joint settlement between the western allies and the soviet union permitted the reunification of austria as a democratic state officially nonaligned with any political bloc although in practice having better relations with the western allies. a denazification program in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of exnazis from power although this policy moved towards amnesty and reintegration of exnazis into west german society..germany lost a quarter of its prewar  territory. among the eastern territories silesia neumark and most of pomerania were taken over by poland and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces as well as three million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. by the s onefifth of west germans were refugees from the east. the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line from which two million poles were expelled. northeast romania parts of eastern finland and the baltic states were annexed into the soviet union. italy lost its monarchy colonial empire and some european territories..in an effort to maintain world peace the allies formed the united nations which officially came into existence on  october  and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in  as a common standard for all member nations. the great powers that were the victors of the warfrance china the united kingdom the soviet union and the united statesbecame the permanent members of the uns security council. the five permanent members remain so to the present although there have been two seat changes between the republic of china and the peoples republic of china in  and between the soviet union and its successor state the russian federation following the dissolution of the soviet union in . the alliance between the western allies and the soviet union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over..besides germany the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence. most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere which led to establishment of communistled regimes with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities. as a result east germany poland hungary romania bulgaria czechoslovakia and albania became soviet satellite states. communist yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy causing tension with the soviet union. a communist uprising in greece was put down with angloamerican support and the country remained aligned with the west..postwar division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances the united statesled nato and the sovietled warsaw pact. the long period of political tensions and military competition between themthe cold warwould be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world..in asia the united states led the occupation of japan and administered japans former islands in the western pacific while the soviets annexed south sakhalin and the kuril islands. korea formerly under japanese colonial rule was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the united states in the south between  and . separate republics emerged on both sides of the th parallel in  each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of korea which led ultimately to the korean war..in china nationalist and communist forces resumed the civil war in june . communist forces were victorious and established the peoples republic of china on the mainland while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in . in the middle east the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the escalation of the arabisraeli conflict. while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful leading to decolonisation..the global economy suffered heavily from the war although participating nations were affected differently. the united states emerged much richer than any other nation leading to a baby boom and by  its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers and it dominated the world economy. the allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in western germany from  to . due to international trade interdependencies this policy led to an economic stagnation in europe and delayed european recovery from the war for several years..at the bretton woods conference in july  the allied nations drew up an economic framework for the postwar world. the agreement created the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which later became part of the world bank group. the bretton woods system lasted until . recovery began with the mid currency reform in western germany and was sped up by the liberalisation of european economic policy that the us marshall plan economic aid  both directly and indirectly caused. the post west german recovery has been called the german economic miracle. italy also experienced an economic boom and the french economy rebounded. by contrast the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin and although receiving a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance more than any other european country it continued in relative economic decline for decades. the soviet union despite enormous human and material losses also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate postwar era having seized and transferred most of germanys industrial plants and exacted war reparations from its satellite states. japan recovered much later. china returned to its prewar industrial production by ..estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary because many deaths went unrecorded. most suggest million people died about  million military personnel and million civilians..the soviet union alone lost around million people during the war including .million military and million civilian deaths. a quarter of the total people in the soviet union were wounded or killed. germany sustained .million military losses mostly on the eastern front and during the final battles in germany..an estimated  to million civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of hitlers racist policies including mass killing of around million jews along with roma homosexuals at least .million ethnic poles and millions of other slavs including russians ukrainians and belarusians and other ethnic and minority groups. between  and  more than  ethnic serbs along with roma and jews were persecuted and murdered by the axisaligned croatian ustae in yugoslavia. concurrently muslims and croats were persecuted and killed by serb nationalist chetniks with an estimated  victims of which  were civilians. also more than  poles were massacred by the ukrainian insurgent army in the volhynia massacres between  and . at the same time about  ukrainians were killed by the polish home army and other polish units in reprisal attacks..in asia and the pacific the number of people killed by japanese troops remains contested. according to r.j. rummel the japanese killed between million and more than million people with the most probable case of almost  people. according to the british historian m. r. d. foot civilian deaths are between  million and  million whereas chinese military casualties killed and wounded are estimated to be over five million. other estimates say that up to  million people most of them civilians were killed. the most infamous japanese atrocity was the nanjing massacre in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were raped and murdered. mitsuyoshi himeta reported that .million casualties occurred during the three alls policy. general yasuji okamura implemented the policy in hebei and shandong..axis forces employed biological and chemical weapons. the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china see unit  and in early conflicts against the soviets. both the germans and the japanese tested such weapons against civilians and sometimes on prisoners of war..the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of  polish officers and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd secret police along with mass civilian deportations to siberia in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army. soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories especially in germany. the exact number of german women and girls raped by soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands and possibly as many as two million while figures for women raped by german soldiers in the soviet union go as far as ten million..the mass bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world warii. the usaaf bombed a total of  japanese cities killing  civilians including the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki and destroying  of builtup areas..nazi germany under the dictatorship of adolf hitler was responsible for murdering about million jews in what is now known as the holocaust. they also murdered an additional million others who were deemed unworthy of life including the disabled and mentally ill soviet prisoners of war romani homosexuals freemasons and jehovahs witnesses as part of a program of deliberate extermination in effect becoming a genocidal state. soviet pows were kept in especially unbearable conditions and .million soviet pows out of .million died in nazi camps during the war. in addition to concentration camps death camps were created in nazi germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. nazi germany extensively used forced labourers about million europeans from germanoccupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in german industry agriculture and war economy..the soviet gulag became a de facto system of deadly camps during  when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied in  by the soviet union as well as axis pows. by the end of the war most soviet pows liberated from nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to nkvd evaluation and  were sent to the gulag as real or perceived nazi collaborators..japanese prisonerofwar camps many of which were used as labour camps also had high death rates. the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was  percent for american pows  percent seven times that of pows under the germans and italians. while  prisoners from the uk  from the netherlands and  from the united states were released after the surrender of japan the number of chinese released was only ..at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between  and  by the east asia development board or kain for work in mines and war industries. after  the number reached million. in java between and million rmusha japanese manual labourers were forced to work by the japanese military. about  of these javanese labourers were sent to other japaneseheld areas in southeast asia and only  were repatriated to java..in europe occupation came under two forms. in western northern and central europe france norway denmark the low countries and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly .billion reichsmarks .billion us dollars by the end of the war this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products military equipment raw materials and other goods. thus the income from occupied nations was over  percent of the income germany collected from taxation a figure which increased to nearly  percent of total german income as the war went on..in the east the intended gains of lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating frontlines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders. unlike in the west the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the inferior people of slavic descent most german advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes. the nazis killed an estimated .million ethnic poles in addition to polishjewish victims of the holocaust. although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories they did not significantly hamper german operations in either the east or the west until late ..in asia japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia coprosperity sphere essentially a japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. although japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from european domination japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them. during japans initial conquest it captured  barrels m of oil  tonnes left behind by retreating allied forces and by  was able to get production in the dutch east indies up to million barrels m of oil . million tonnes  percent of its  output rate..in the s britain and the united states together controlled almost  of world mineral outputessential for projecting military power..in europe before the outbreak of the war the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. in  the western allies united kingdom france poland and the british dominions had a  percent larger population and a  percent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers germany and italy including colonies the allies had more than a  advantage in population and a nearly  advantage in gdp. in asia at the same time china had roughly six times the population of japan but only an  percent higher gdp this reduces to three times the population and only a  percent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included..the united states produced about twothirds of all munitions used by the allies in world war ii including warships transports warplanes artillery tanks trucks and ammunition. although the allies economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan they became the decisive factor by  after the united states and soviet union joined the allies and the war evolved into one of attrition. while the allies ability to outproduce the axis was partly due to more access to natural resources other factors such as germany and japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force allied strategic bombing and germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. additionally neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war and had not equipped themselves to do so. to improve their production germany and japan used millions of slave labourers germany enslaved about million people mostly from eastern europe while japan used more than million people in far east asia..aircraft were used for reconnaissance as fighters bombers and groundsupport and each role developed considerably. innovations included airlift the capability to quickly move limited highpriority supplies equipment and personnel and strategic bombing the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemys ability to wage war. antiaircraft weaponry also advanced including defences such as radar and surfacetoair artillery in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide..advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war actions at taranto pearl harbor and the coral sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship. in the atlantic escort carriers became a vital part of allied convoys increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the midatlantic gap. carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured. submarines which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. the british focused development on antisubmarine weaponry and tactics such as sonar and convoys while germany focused on improving its offensive capability with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics. gradually improving allied technologies such as the leigh light hedgehog squid and homing torpedoes proved effective against german submarines..land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of world wari which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry to increased mobility and combined arms. the tank which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the first world war had evolved into the primary weapon. in the late s tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world wari and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed armour and firepower. at the start of the war most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications. this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour and german doctrine of avoiding tankversustank combat. this along with germanys use of combined arms were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across poland and france. many means of destroying tanks including indirect artillery antitank guns both towed and selfpropelled mines shortranged infantry antitank weapons and other tanks were used. even with largescale mechanisation infantry remained the backbone of all forces and throughout the war most infantry were equipped similarly to world wari. the portable machine gun spread a notable example being the german mg  and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings. the assault rifle a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces..most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines the most wellknown being the german enigma machine. development of sigint signals intelligence and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes and british ultra a pioneering method for decoding enigma that benefited from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war. another component of military intelligence was deception which the allies used to great effect in operations such as mincemeat and bodyguard..other technological and engineering feats achieved during or as a result of the war include the worlds first programmable computers z colossus and eniac guided missiles and modern rockets the manhattan projects development of nuclear weapons operations research the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel. penicillin was first developed massproduced and used during the war....the national basketball association nba is a professional

international young mens christian association training school now springfield college in springfield massachusetts was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. he sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long new england winters. after rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walledin gymnasiums he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. .naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each basket or point scored. this quickly proved tedious so naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket..shortly after senda berenson instructor of physical culture at the nearby smith college went to naismith to learn more about the game. fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach she started to organize games with her pupils following adjusted

ball construction method was invented and this change to the game was endorsed by naismith whereas in american football the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day. the first balls made specifically for basketball were brown and it was only in the late s that tony hinkle searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike introduced the orange ball that is now in common use. dribbling was not part of the original game except for the bounce pass to teammates. passing the ball was the primary means of ball movement. dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls. dribbling was common by  with a rule against the double dribble by ..the peach baskets were used until  when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards. a further change was soon made so the ball merely passed through. whenever a person got the ball in the basket their team would gain a point. whichever team got the most points won the game. the baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots. the backboard was introduced to prevent this interference it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots. naismiths handwritten diaries discovered by his granddaughter in early  indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented which incorporated rules from a childrens game called duck on a rock as many had failed before it..frank mahan one of the players from the original first game approached naismith after the christmas break in early  asking him what he intended to call his new game. naismith replied that he had not thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started. mahan suggested that it be called naismith ball at which he laughed saying that a name like that would kill any game. mahan then said why not call it basketball naismith replied we have a basket and a ball and it seems to me that would be a good name for it. the first official game was played in the ymca gymnasium in albany new york on january

clearly visible number unique within the team printed on both the front and back. players wear hightop sneakers that provide extra ankle support. typically team names players names and outside of north america sponsors are printed on the uniforms..a limited number of timeouts clock stoppages requested by a coach or sometimes mandated in the nba for a short meeting with the players are allowed. they generally last no longer than one minute  seconds in the nba unless for televised games a commercial break is needed..the game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee referred to as crew chief in the nba one or two umpires referred to as referees in the nba and the table officials. for college the nba and many high schools there are a total of three referees on the court. the table officials are responsible for keeping track of each teams scoring timekeeping individual and team fouls player substitutions team possession arrow and the shot clock..the only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court a flat rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends. competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks score sheets scoreboards alternating possession arrows and whistleoperated stopclock systems..a regulation basketball court in international games is  meters  feet long and  meters  feet wide. in the nba and ncaa the court is  by  feet  by  meters. most courts have wood flooring usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension. the name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle..the basket is a steel rim  inches cm diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures  by . feet . by . meters and one basket is at each end of the court. the white outlined box on the backboard is  inches cm high and  feet cm wide. at almost all levels of competition the top of the rim is exactly  feet . meters above the court and  feet . meters inside the baseline. while variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height  a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting. the net must check the ball momentarily as it passes through the basket to aid the visual confirmation that the ball went through. the act of checking the ball has the further advantage of slowing down the ball so the rebound does not go as far..the size of the basketball is also regulated. for men the official ball is . inches cm in circumference size  or a  ball and weighs oz g. if women are playing the official basketball size is . inches cm in circumference size  or a  ball with a weight of oz g. in x a formalized version of the halfcourt on game a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size  ball but the weight of a size  ball is used in all competitions mens womens and mixed teams..the ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot passed between players thrown tapped rolled or dribbled bouncing the ball while running..the ball must stay within the court the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession. the ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line or touches any player or object that is out of bounds..there are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling. nor may a player stop their dribble and then resume dribbling. a dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble giving this infraction the name double dribble. within a dribble the player cannot carry the ball by placing their hand on the bottom of the ball doing so is known as carrying the ball. a team once having established ball control in the front half of their court may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it. a violation of these rules results in loss of possession..the ball may not be kicked nor be struck with the fist. for the offense a violation of these rules results in loss of possession for the defense most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds..there are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway  seconds in fiba and the nba  seconds in ncaa and high school for both sexes before attempting a shot  seconds in fiba the nba and u sports canadian universities play for both sexes and  seconds in ncaa play for both sexes holding the ball while closely guarded  seconds and remaining in the restricted area known as the freethrow lane or the key  seconds. these rules are designed to promote more offense..there are also limits on how players may block an opponents field goal attempt or help a teammates field goal attempt. goaltending is a defenders touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket while the related violation of basket interference is the touching of a ball that is on the rim or above the basket or by a player reaching through the basket from below. goaltending and basket interference committed by a defender result in awarding the basket to the offense while basket interference committed by an offensive player results in cancelling the basket if one is scored. the defense gains possession in all cases of goaltending or basket interference..an attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul. these are most commonly committed by defensive players however they can be committed by offensive players as well. players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting depending on whether the shot was successful. one point is awarded for making a free throw which is attempted from a line  feet .m from the basket..the referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal sometimes resulting in controversy. the calling of fouls can vary between games leagues and referees..there is a second category of fouls called technical fouls which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook or for unsportsmanlike conduct. these infractions result in one or two free throws which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time. repeated incidents can result in disqualification. a blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul flagrant foul in the nba. in fiba and ncaa womens basketball a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul while in leagues other than the nba such a foul is referred to as flagrant..if a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period quarter or half  four for nba ncaa womens and international games  the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent nonshooting fouls for that period the number depending on the league. in the us college mens game and high school games for both sexes if a team reaches  fouls in a half the opposing team is awarded one free throw along with a second shot if the first is made. this is called shooting oneandone. if a team exceeds  fouls in the half the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half..when a team shoots foul shots the opponents may not interfere with the shooter nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air..after a team has committed a specified number of fouls the other team is said to be in the bonus. on scoreboards this is usually signified with an indicator light reading bonus or penalty with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team. some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed..if a team misses the first shot of a twoshot situation the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play..if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot. a player fouled while attempting a regular twopoint shot thus receives two shots and a player fouled while attempting a threepoint shot receives three shots..if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point. in combination with a regular shot this is called a threepoint play or fourpoint play or more colloquially an and one because of the basket made at the time of the foul  or  points and the additional free throw  point..although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever they have evolved as part of basketball. during the early years of basketballs evolution two guards two forwards and one center were used. in more recent times specific positions evolved but the current trend advocated by many top coaches including mike krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it. popular descriptions of positions include.point guard often called the  usually the fastest player on the team organizes the teams offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time..shooting guard the  creates a high volume of shots on offense mainly longranged and guards the opponents best perimeter player on defense..small forward the  often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration on defense seeks rebounds and steals but sometimes plays more actively..power forward the  plays offensively often with their back to the basket on defense plays under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in mantoman defense..center the  uses height and size to score on offense to protect the basket closely on defense or to rebound..the above descriptions are flexible. for most teams today the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings as do the power forward and center who are often called post players. while most teams describe two players as guards two as forwards and one as a center on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations..there are two main defensive strategies zone defense and mantoman defense. in a zone defense each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court. zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball a manoeuver known as a trap. in a mantoman defense each defensive player guards a specific opponent..offensive plays are more varied normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. a quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut. a legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate by standing in the defenders way such that the teammate cuts next to him is a screen or pick. the two plays are combined in the pick and roll in which a player sets a pick and then rolls away from the pick towards the basket. screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. on court the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur..shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket methods varying with players and situations..typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. a player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand the shooting arm slightly above the head with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. the ball is usually shot by jumping though not always and extending the shooting arm. the shooting arm fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball known as a followthrough. players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. the ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial but generally a proper arc is recommended. players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket..the two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot. both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot. in a set shot the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor this is typically used for free throws. for a jump shot the throw is taken in midair with the ball being released near the top of the jump. this provides much greater power and range and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation..another common shot is called the layup. this shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket and to lay the ball up and into the basket typically off the backboard the backboardfree underhand version is called a finger roll. the most crowdpleasing and typically highestpercentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward through the basket while touching it..another shot that is less common than the layup is the circus shot. the circus shot is a lowpercentage shot that is flipped heaved scooped or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is offbalance airborne falling down or facing away from the basket. a backshot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket and may be shot with the dominant hand or both but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful..a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball. a particularly bad shot or one that only hits the backboard is jocularly called a brick. the hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping either to make a slam dunk layup or jump shot..the objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard. this plays a major role in the game as most possessions end when a team misses a shot. there are two categories of rebounds offensive rebounds in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession and defensive rebounds in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball. the majority of rebounds are defensive as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots for example about  of rebounds in the nba are defensive..a pass is a method of moving the ball between players. most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy..a staple pass is the chest pass. the ball is passed directly from the passers chest to the receivers chest. a proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react..another type of pass is the bounce pass. here the passer bounces the ball crisply about twothirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver. the ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. the bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept kicking the ball deliberately is a violation. thus players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments or to pass around a defender..the overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender. the ball is released while over the passers head..the outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound. the next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass..the crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept. good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. a special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate. this is called a nolook pass..another advanced style of passing is the behindtheback pass which as the description implies involves throwing the ball behind the passers back to a teammate. although some players can perform such a pass effectively many coaches discourage nolook or behindtheback passes believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations..dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. to dribble a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it this ensures greater control..when dribbling past an opponent the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball. it is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands..good dribblers or ball handlers tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand making it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball. good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs between their legs and switch directions suddenly making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against. this is called a crossover which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling..a skilled player can dribble without watching the ball using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the balls location. by not having to focus on the ball a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from himher..a block is performed when after a shot is attempted a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball. in almost all variants of play it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc this is known as goaltending. it is also illegal under nba and mens ncaa basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim. under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim. after the ball hits the rim it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed..to block a shot a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released. thus height can be an advantage in blocking. players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions. however with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap even shorter players can be effective shot blockers..at the professional level most male players are above feet inches .m and most women above feet inches .m. guards for whom physical coordination and ballhandling skills are crucial tend to be the smallest players. almost all forwards in the top mens pro leagues are feet inches .m or taller. most centers are over feet inches .m tall. according to a survey given to all nba teams the average height of all nba players is just under feet inches .m with the average weight being close to  pounds kg. the tallest players ever in the nba were manute bol and gheorghe murean who were both feet inches .m tall. at feet inches .m margo dydek was the tallest player in the history of the wnba..the shortest player ever to play in the nba is muggsy bogues at feet inches .m. other averageheight or relatively short players have thrived at the pro level including anthony spud webb who was feet inches .m tall but had a inch .m vertical leap giving him significant height when jumping and temeka johnson who won the wnba rookie of the year award and a championship with the phoenix mercury while standing only feet inches .m. while shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths..players regularly inflate their height in high school or college. many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts who prefer taller players. charles barkley stated ive been measured at  . but i started in college at . sam smith a former writer from the chicago tribune said we sort of know the heights because after camp the sheet comes out. but you use that height and the player gets mad. and then you hear from his agent. or you file your story with the right height and the copy desk changes it because they have the official n.b.a. media guide which is wrong. so you sort of go along with the joke..since the  nba season heights of nba players are recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off..variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball using common basketball skills and equipment primarily the ball and basket. some variations only have superficial rule changes while others are distinct games with varying degrees of influence from basketball. other variations include childrens games contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills..an earlier version of basketball played primarily by women and girls was sixonsix basketball. horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net approximately .m.m. the sport is like a combination of polo rugby and basketball. there is even a form played on donkeys known as donkey basketball which has attracted criticism from animal rights groups..perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the halfcourt game played in informal settings without referees or strict rules. only one basket is used and the ball must be taken back or cleared  passed or dribbled outside the threepoint line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other. halfcourt games require less cardiovascular stamina since players need not run back and forth a full court. halfcourt raises the number of players that can use a court or conversely can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full on teams..halfcourt basketball is usually played on on or on. the last of these variations is gradually gaining official recognition as x originally known as fiba . it was first tested at the  asian indoor games in macau and the first official tournaments were held at the  asian youth games and the  youth olympics both in singapore. the first fiba x youth world championships were held in rimini italy in  with the first fiba x world championships for senior teams following a year later in athens. the sport is highly tipped to become an olympic sport as early as . in the summer of  the big basketball league a professional x half court basketball league that features former nba players began. the big features several rule variants including a fourpoint field goal..variations of basketball with their own page or subsection include.spinoffs from basketball that are now separate sports include.basketball as a social and communal sport features environments rules and demographics different from those seen in professional and televised basketball..basketball is played widely as an extracurricular intramural or amateur sport in schools and colleges. notable institutions of recreational basketball include.fantasy basketball was popularized during the s by espn fantasy sports nba.com and yahoo fantasy sports. on the model of fantasy baseball and football players create fictional teams select professional basketball players to play on these teams through a mock draft or trades then calculate points based on the players realworld performance...the bretton woods system of monetary management established the rules for commercial relations among  countries including the united states canada western european countries and australia after the  bretton woods agreement until the jamaica accords in . the bretton woods system was the first example of a fully negotiated monetary order intended to govern monetary relations among independent states. the bretton woods system required countries to guarantee convertibility of their currencies into u.s. dollars to within  of fixed parity rates with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at us per troy ounce of fine gold or . gram fine gold per dollar. it also envisioned greater cooperation among countries in order to prevent future competitive devaluations and thus established the international monetary fund imf to monitor exchange rates and lend reserve currencies to countries with balance of payments deficits..preparing to rebuild the international economic system while world war ii was still being fought  delegates from all  allied countries gathered at the mount washington hotel in bretton woods new hampshire united states for the united nations monetary and financial conference also known as the bretton woods conference. the delegates deliberated from  to  july  and signed the bretton woods agreement on its final day. setting up a system of rules institutions and procedures to regulate the international monetary system these accords established the imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which today is part of the world bank group. the united states which controlled twothirds of the worlds gold insisted that the bretton woods system rest on both gold and the us dollar. soviet representatives attended the conference but later declined to ratify the final agreements charging that the institutions they had created were branches of wall street. these organizations became operational in  after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement. according to barry eichengreen the bretton woods system operated successfully due to three factors low international capital mobility tight financial regulation and the dominant economic and financial position of the united states and the dollar..eurodollar growth increased capital flows challenging regulation of capital movements. on  august  the united states ended the convertibility of the us dollar to gold effectively bringing the bretton woods system to an end and rendering the dollar a fiat currency. shortly thereafter many fixed currencies such as the pound sterling also became freefloating and the subsequent era has been characterized by floating exchange rates. the end of bretton woods was formally ratified by the jamaica accords in ..the planners at bretton woods hoped to avoid a repetition of the treaty of versailles after world war i which had created enough economic and political tension to lead to wwii. after world war i britain owed the u.s. substantial sums which britain could not repay because it had used the funds to support allies such as france during the war the allies could not pay back britain so britain could not pay back the u.s. the solution at versailles for the french british and americans seemed to entail ultimately charging germany for the debts. if the demands on germany were unrealistic then it was unrealistic for france to pay back britain and for britain to pay back the us. thus many assets on bank balance sheets internationally were actually unrecoverable loans which culminated in the  banking crisis. intransigent insistence by creditor countries for the repayment of allied war debts and reparations combined with an inclination to isolationism led to a breakdown of the international financial system and a worldwide economic depression..the beggar thy neighbour policies that emerged as the crisis continued saw some trading countries using currency devaluations in an attempt to increase their competitiveness i.e. raise exports and lower imports though recent research suggests this de facto inflationary policy probably offset some of the contractionary forces in world price levels see eichengreen how to prevent a currency war..in the s international flows of speculative financial capital increased leading to extremes in balance of payments situations in various european countries and the us. in the s world markets never broke through the barriers and restrictions on international trade and investment volume  barriers haphazardly constructed nationally motivated and imposed. the various anarchic and often autarkic protectionist and neomercantilist national policies  often mutually inconsistent  that emerged over the first half of the decade worked inconsistently and selfdefeatingly to promote national import substitution increase national exports divert foreign investment and trade flows and even prevent certain categories of crossborder trade and investment outright. global central bankers attempted to manage the situation by meeting with each other but their understanding of the situation as well as difficulties in communicating internationally hindered their abilities. the lesson was that simply having responsible hardworking central bankers was not enough..britain in the s had an exclusionary trade bloc with countries and territories of the british empire known as the sterling area. if britain imported more than it exported to such trading partners recipients of pounds sterling within these countries tended to put them into london banks. this meant that though britain was running a trade deficit it had a financial account surplus and payments balanced. increasingly britains positive balance of payments required keeping the wealth from across its empire in british banks. one incentive for say south african holders of rand to park their wealth in london and to keep the money in sterling was a strongly valued pound sterling. in the s imports from the us threatened certain parts of the british domestic market for manufactured goods and the way out of the trade deficit was to devalue the currency. but britain could not devalue or the empire surplus would leave its banking system..nazi germany also worked with a bloc of controlled countries by . germany forced trading partners with a surplus to spend that surplus importing products from germany. thus britain survived by keeping sterlingusing countries surpluses in its banking system and germany survived by forcing trading partners to purchase its own products. the u.s. was concerned that a sudden dropoff in war spending might return its population to the unemployment levels of the s and so wanted sterlingusing countries and everyone in europe to be able to import from the us hence the u.s. supported free trade and international convertibility of currencies into gold or dollars..when many of the same experts who observed the s became the architects of a new unified postwar system at bretton woods their guiding principles became no more beggar thy neighbor and control flows of speculative financial capital. preventing a repetition of this process of competitive devaluations was desired but in a way that would not force debtor countries to contract their industrial bases by keeping interest rates at a level high enough to attract foreign bank deposits. john maynard keynes wary of repeating the great depression was behind britains proposal that surplus countries be forced by a useitorloseit mechanism to either import from debtor states build factories in debtor states or donate to debtor states. the u.s. opposed keynes plan and a senior official at the u.s. treasury harry dexter white rejected keynes proposals in favor of an international monetary fund with enough resources to counteract destabilizing flows of speculative finance. however unlike the modern imf whites proposed fund would have counteracted dangerous speculative flows automatically with no political strings attachedi.e. no imf conditionality. economic historian brad delong writes that on almost every point where he was overruled by the americans keynes was later proved correct by events..today these key s events look different to scholars of the era see the work of barry eichengreen golden fetters the gold standard and the great depression  and how to prevent a currency war in particular devaluations today are viewed with more nuance. ben bernankes opinion on the subject follows.... he proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard. ... for a variety of reasons including a desire of the federal reserve to curb the u.s. stock market boom monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late sa contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard. what was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of  instigated an international scramble for gold. sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries  substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies. monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices output and employment. effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints but disputes over world war i reparations and war debts and the insularity and inexperience of the federal reserve among other factors prevented this outcome. as a result individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and reestablishing domestic monetary stability a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until france and the other gold bloc countries finally left gold in . great depression b. bernanke.in  at bretton woods as a result of the collective conventional wisdom of the time representatives from all the leading allied states collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates indirectly disciplined by a us dollar tied to golda system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies. flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks. this meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment fdii.e. construction of factories overseas rather than international currency manipulation or bond markets. although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system all agreed on the need for tight controls..also based on experience of the interwar years u.s. planners developed a concept of economic securitythat a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace. one of those who saw such a security link was cordell hull the united states secretary of state from  to . hull believed that the fundamental causes of the two world wars lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare. hull argued.nhampered trade dovetailed with peace high tariffs trade barriers and unfair economic competition with war  if we could get a freer flow of tradefreer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructionsso that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance of lasting peace..the developed countries also agreed that the liberal international economic system required governmental intervention. in the aftermath of the great depression public management of the economy had emerged as a primary activity of governments in the developed states. employment stability and growth were now important subjects of public policy..in turn the role of government in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic wellbeing. the system of economic protection for atrisk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the great depression which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy and out of the theoretical contributions of the keynesian school of economics which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections..however increased government intervention in domestic economy brought with it isolationist sentiment that had a profoundly negative effect on international economics. the priority of national goals independent national action in the interwar period and the failure to perceive that those national goals could not be realized without some form of international collaborationall resulted in beggarthyneighbor policies such as high tariffs competitive devaluations that contributed to the breakdown of the goldbased international monetary system domestic political instability and international war. the lesson learned was as the principal architect of the bretton woods system new dealer harry dexter white put it.the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will  inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale..to ensure economic stability and political peace states agreed to cooperate to closely regulate the production of their currencies to maintain fixed exchange rates between countries with the aim of more easily facilitating international trade. this was the foundation of the u.s. vision of postwar world free trade which also involved lowering tariffs and among other things maintaining a balance of trade via fixed exchange rates that would be favorable to the capitalist system..thus the more developed market economies agreed with the u.s. vision of postwar international economic management which intended to create and maintain an effective international monetary system and foster the reduction of barriers to trade and capital flows. in a sense the new international monetary system was a return to a system similar to the prewar gold standard only using u.s. dollars as the worlds new reserve currency until international trade reallocated the worlds gold supply..thus the new system would be devoid initially of governments meddling with their currency supply as they had during the years of economic turmoil preceding wwii. instead governments would closely police the production of their currencies and ensure that they would not artificially manipulate their price levels. if anything bretton woods was a return to a time devoid of increased governmental intervention in economies and currency systems..the atlantic charter drafted during u.s. president franklin d. roosevelts august  meeting with british prime minister winston churchill on a ship in the north atlantic was the most notable precursor to the bretton woods conference. like woodrow wilson before him whose fourteen points had outlined u.s. aims in the aftermath of the first world war roosevelt set forth a range of ambitious goals for the postwar world even before the u.s. had entered the second world war..the atlantic charter affirmed the right of all states to equal access to trade and raw materials. moreover the charter called for freedom of the seas a principal u.s. foreign policy aim since france and britain had first threatened u.s. shipping in the s the disarmament of aggressors and the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security..as the war drew to a close the bretton woods conference was the culmination of some two and a half years of planning for postwar reconstruction by the treasuries of the u.s. and the uk. u.s. representatives studied with their british counterparts the reconstitution of what had been lacking between the two world wars a system of international payments that would let countries trade without fear of sudden currency depreciation or wild exchange rate fluctuationsailments that had nearly paralyzed world capitalism during the great depression..without a strong european market for u.s. goods and services most policymakers believed the u.s. economy would be unable to sustain the prosperity it had achieved during the war. in addition u.s. unions had only grudgingly accepted governmentimposed restraints on their demands during the war but they were willing to wait no longer particularly as inflation cut into the existing wage scales with painful force by the end of  there had already been major strikes in the automobile electrical and steel industries..in early  bernard baruch described the spirit of bretton woods as if we can stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines oh boy oh boy what long term prosperity we will have. the united states could therefore use its position of influence to reopen and control the rules of the world economy so as to give unhindered access to all countries markets and materials..united states allieseconomically exhausted by the warneeded u.s. assistance to rebuild their domestic production and to finance their international trade indeed they needed it to survive..before the war the french and the british realized that they could no longer compete with u.s. industries in an open marketplace. during the s the british created their own economic bloc to shut out u.s. goods. churchill did not believe that he could surrender that protection after the war so he watered down the atlantic charters free access clause before agreeing to it..yet u.s. officials were determined to open their access to the british empire. the combined value of british and u.s. trade was well over half of all the worlds trade in goods. for the u.s. to open global markets it first had to split the british trade empire. while britain had economically dominated the th century u.s. officials intended the second half of the th to be under u.s. hegemony..a senior official of the bank of england commented.one of the reasons bretton woods worked was that the u.s. was clearly the most powerful country at the table and so ultimately was able to impose its will on the others including an oftendismayed britain. at the time one senior official at the bank of england described the deal reached at bretton woods as the greatest blow to britain next to the war largely because it underlined the way financial power had moved from the uk to the us..a devastated britain had little choice. two world wars had destroyed the countrys principal industries that paid for the importation of half of the nations food and nearly all its raw materials except coal. the british had no choice but to ask for aid. not until the united states signed an agreement on  december  to grant britain aid of . billion did the british parliament ratify the bretton woods agreements which occurred later in december ..free trade relied on the free convertibility of currencies. negotiators at the bretton woods conference fresh from what they perceived as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the s concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall the free flow of trade..the new economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment trade and payments. unlike national economies however the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. in the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard but the architects of bretton woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. instead they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the u.s. dollar which was a gold standard currency for central banks as a reserve currency..in the th and early th centuries gold played a key role in international monetary transactions. the gold standard was used to back currencies the international value of currency was determined by its fixed relationship to gold gold was used to settle international accounts. the gold standard maintained fixed exchange rates that were seen as desirable because they reduced the risk when trading with other countries..imbalances in international trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard. a country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. the resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports thus the deficit would be rectified. any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend..this decrease in the amount of money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure. supplementing the use of gold in this period was the british pound. based on the dominant british economy the pound became a reserve transaction and intervention currency. but the pound was not up to the challenge of serving as the primary world currency given the weakness of the british economy after the second world war..the architects of bretton woods had conceived of a system wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal. yet in an era of more activist economic policy governments did not seriously consider permanently fixed rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the th century. gold production was not even sufficient to meet the demands of growing international trade and investment. further a sizable share of the worlds known gold reserves was located in the soviet union which would later emerge as a cold war rival to the united states and western europe..the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the u.s. dollar. the strength of the u.s. economy the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold  an ounce and the commitment of the u.s. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold. in fact the dollar was even better than gold it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold..the rules of bretton woods set forth in the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd provided for a system of fixed exchange rates. the rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the convertibility of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade..what emerged was the pegged rate currency regime. members were required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the reserve currency a peg and to maintain exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity a band by intervening in their foreign exchange markets that is buying or selling foreign money..in theory the reserve currency would be the bancor a world currency unit that was never implemented proposed by john maynard keynes however the united states objected and their request was granted making the reserve currency the u.s. dollar. this meant that other countries would peg their currencies to the u.s. dollar andonce convertibility was restoredwould buy and sell u.s. dollars to keep market exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity. thus the u.s. dollar took over the role that gold had played under the gold standard in the international financial system..meanwhile to bolster confidence in the dollar the u.s. agreed separately to link the dollar to gold at the rate of  per ounce. at this rate foreign governments and central banks could exchange dollars for gold. bretton woods established a system of payments based on the dollar which defined all currencies in relation to the dollar itself convertible into gold and above all as good as gold for trade. u.s. currency was now effectively the world currency the standard to which every other currency was pegged..the u.s. dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and it was the only currency that was backed by gold. additionally all european states that had been involved in world war ii were highly in debt and transferred large amounts of gold into the united states a fact that contributed to the supremacy of the united states. thus the u.s. dollar was strongly appreciated in the rest of the world and therefore became the key currency of the bretton woods system..member countries could only change their par value by more than  with imf approval which was contingent on imf determination that its balance of payments was in a fundamental disequilibrium. the formal definition of fundamental disequilibrium was never determined leading to uncertainty of approvals and attempts to repeatedly devalue by less than  instead. any country that changed without approval or after being denied approval was denied access to the imf..maintaining the fixed exchange system required countries to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves to intervene in markets and prevent fluctuations away from the pegged rate. this also meant that international movement of capital could not be too large because that might lead to large fluctuations in the exchange rate and necessitate costly market interventions that risked depleting a countrys foreign exchange reserves..the bretton woods conference led to the establishment of the imf and the ibrd now the world bank which remain powerful forces in the world economy as of the s..a major point of common ground at the conference was the goal to avoid a recurrence of the closed markets and economic warfare that had characterized the s. thus negotiators at bretton woods also agreed that there was a need for an institutional forum for international cooperation on monetary matters. already in  the british economist john maynard keynes emphasized the importance of rulebased regimes to stabilize business expectationssomething he accepted in the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates. currency troubles in the interwar years it was felt had been greatly exacerbated by the absence of any established procedure or machinery for intergovernmental consultation..as a result of the establishment of agreed upon structures and rules of international economic interaction conflict over economic issues was minimized and the significance of the economic aspect of international relations seemed to recede..officially established on  december  when the  participating countries at the conference of bretton woods signed its articles of agreement the imf was to be the keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management. the fund commenced its financial operations on  march . imf approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of . it advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system and lent reserve currencies to countries that had incurred balance of payment debts..the big question at the bretton woods conference with respect to the institution that would emerge as the imf was the issue of future access to international liquidity and whether that source should be akin to a world central bank able to create new reserves at will or a more limited borrowing mechanism..although attended by  governments discussions at the conference were dominated by two rival plans developed by the united states and britain. writing to the british treasury keynes who took the lead at the conference did not want many countries. he believed that those from the colonies and semicolonies had nothing to contribute and will merely encumber the ground..as the chief international economist at the u.s. treasury in  harry dexter white drafted the u.s. blueprint for international access to liquidity which competed with the plan drafted for the british treasury by keynes. overall whites scheme tended to favor incentives designed to create price stability within the worlds economies while keynes wanted a system that encouraged economic growth. the collective agreement was an enormous international undertaking that took two years prior to the conference to prepare for. it consisted of numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings to reach common ground on what policies would make up the bretton woods system..at the time gaps between the white and keynes plans seemed enormous. white basically wanted a fund to reverse destabilizing flows of financial capital automatically. white proposed a new monetary institution called the stabilization fund that would be funded with a finite pool of national currencies and gold that would effectively limit the supply of reserve credit. keynes wanted incentives for the u.s. to help britain and the rest of europe rebuild after wwii. outlining the difficulty of creating a system that every nation could accept in his speech at the closing plenary session of the bretton woods conference on  july  keynes stated.we the delegates of this conference mr president have been trying to accomplish something very difficult to accomplish. it has been our task to find a common measure a common standard a common rule acceptable to each and not irksome to any..keynes proposals would have established a world reserve currency which he thought might be called bancor administered by a central bank vested with the power to create money and with the authority to take actions on a much larger scale..in the case of balance of payments imbalances keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. as outlined by keynes countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries build factories in debtor countries or donate to themand thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. thus keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much of the burden on the deficit country would be deflationary..but the united states as a likely creditor nation and eager to take on the role of the worlds economic powerhouse used whites plan but targeted many of keyness concerns. white saw a role for global intervention in an imbalance only when it was caused by currency speculation..although a compromise was reached on some points because of the overwhelming economic and military power of the united states the participants at bretton woods largely agreed on whites plan. whites plan was designed not merely to secure the rise and world economic domination of the united states but to ensure that as the outgoing superpower britain would be shuffled even further from centre stage..what emerged largely reflected u.s. preferences a system of subscriptions and quotas embedded in the imf which itself was to be no more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold subscribed by each country as opposed to a world central bank capable of creating money. the fund was charged with managing various countries trade deficits so that they would not produce currency devaluations that would trigger a decline in imports..the imf is provided with a fund composed of contributions from member countries in gold and their own currencies. the original quotas were to total . billion. when joining the imf members are assigned quotas that reflect their relative economic powerand as a sort of credit deposit are obliged to pay a subscription of an amount commensurate with the quota. they pay the subscription as  in gold or currency convertible into gold effectively the dollar which at the founding was the only currency then still directly gold convertible for central banks and  in their own currency..quota subscriptions form the largest source of money at the imfs disposal. the imf set out to use this money to grant loans to member countries with financial difficulties. each member is then entitled to withdraw  of its quota immediately in case of payment problems. if this sum should be insufficient each nation in the system is also able to request loans for foreign currency..in the event of a deficit in the current account fund members when short of reserves would be able to borrow foreign currency in amounts determined by the size of its quota. in other words the higher the countrys contribution was the higher the sum of money it could borrow from the imf..members were required to pay back debts within a period of  months to five years. in turn the imf embarked on setting up rules and procedures to keep a country from going too deeply into debt year after year. the fund would exercise surveillance over other economies for the u.s. treasury in return for its loans to prop up national currencies..imf loans were not comparable to loans issued by a conventional credit institution. instead they were effectively a chance to purchase a foreign currency with gold or the members national currency..the u.s.backed imf plan sought to end restrictions on the transfer of goods and services from one country to another eliminate currency blocs and lift currency exchange controls..the imf was designed to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits. shortrun balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by imf loans which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates. this flexibility meant a member state would not have to induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means. thus countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits. before the second world war european governmentsparticularly britainoften resorted to this..the imf sought to provide for occasional discontinuous exchangerate adjustments changing a members par value by international agreement. member states were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by . this tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports. this would be allowed only if there was a fundamental disequilibrium. a decrease in the value of a countrys money was called a devaluation while an increase in the value of the countrys money was called a revaluation..it was envisioned that these changes in exchange rates would be quite rare. however the concept of fundamental disequilibrium though key to the operation of the par value system was never defined in detail..never before had international monetary cooperation been attempted on a permanent institutional basis. even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments not on a onestate onevote basis but rather in proportion to quotas. since the united states was contributing the most u.s. leadership was the key. under the system of weighted voting the united states exerted a preponderant influence on the imf. the united states held onethird of all imf quotas at the outset enough on its own to veto all changes to the imf charter..in addition the imf was based in washington d.c. and staffed mainly by u.s. economists. it regularly exchanged personnel with the u.s. treasury. when the imf began operations in  president harry s. truman named white as its first u.s. executive director. since no deputy managing director post had yet been created white served occasionally as acting managing director and generally played a highly influential role during the imfs first year. truman had to abandon his original plan of naming white as imf executive director when fbi director j. edgar hoover submitted a report to the president asserting that white was a valuable adjunct to an underground soviet espionage organization who was placing individuals of high regard to soviet intelligence inside the government..the agreement made no provisions to create international reserves. it assumed new gold production would be sufficient. in the event of structural disequilibria it expected that there would be national solutions for example an adjustment in the value of the currency or an improvement by other means of a countrys competitive position. the imf was left with few means however to encourage such national solutions..economists and other planners recognized in  that the new system could only commence after a return to normality following the disruption of world war ii. it was expected that after a brief transition period of no more than five years the international economy would recover and the system would enter into operation..to promote growth of world trade and finance postwar reconstruction of europe the planners at bretton woods created another institution the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which is one of five agencies that make up the world bank group and is perhaps now the most important agency of the group. the ibrd had an authorized capitalization of  billion and was expected to make loans of its own funds to underwrite private loans and to issue securities to raise new funds to make possible a speedy postwar recovery. the ibrd was to be a specialized agency of the united nations charged with making loans for economic development purposes..the bretton woods arrangements were largely adhered to and ratified by the participating governments. it was expected that national monetary reserves supplemented with necessary imf credits would finance any temporary balance of payments disequilibria. but this did not prove sufficient to get europe out of its conundrum..postwar world capitalism suffered from a dollar shortage. the united states was running large balance of trade surpluses and u.s. reserves were immense and growing. it was necessary to reverse this flow. even though all countries wanted to buy u.s. exports dollars had to leave the united states and become available for international use so they could do so. in other words the united states would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit financed by an outflow of u.s. reserves to other countries a u.s. financial account deficit. the u.s. could run a financial deficit by either importing from building plants in or donating to foreign countries. speculative investment was discouraged by the bretton woods agreement and importing from other locations was not appealing in the s because u.s. technology was cutting edge at the time. so multinational corporations and global aid that originated from the u.s. burgeoned..the modest credit facilities of the imf were clearly insufficient to deal with western europes huge balance of payments deficits. the problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the imf board of governors of the provision in the bretton woods articles of agreement that the imf could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. only the united states contribution of  million was actually available for ibrd lending. in addition because the only available market for ibrd bonds was the conservative wall street banking market the ibrd was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy granting loans only when repayment was assured. given these problems by  the imf and the ibrd themselves were admitting that they could not deal with the international monetary systems economic problems..the united states set up the european recovery program marshall plan to provide largescale financial and economic aid for rebuilding europe largely through grants rather than loans. countries belonging to the soviet bloc e.g. poland were invited to receive the grants but were given a favorable agreement with the soviet unions comecon. in a speech at harvard university on  june  u.s. secretary of state george marshall stated.the breakdown of the business structure of europe during the war was complete.  europes requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products  principally from the united states  are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial help or face economic social and political deterioration of a very grave character..from  until  the u.s. deliberately encouraged an outflow of dollars and from  on the united states ran a balance of payments deficit with the intent of providing liquidity for the international economy. dollars flowed out through various u.s. aid programs the truman doctrine entailing aid to the prou.s. greek and turkish regimes which were struggling to suppress communist revolution aid to various prou.s. regimes in the third world and most importantly the marshall plan. from  to  the united states provided  western european countries with  billion in grants..to encourage longterm adjustment the united states promoted european and japanese trade competitiveness. policies for economic controls on the defeated former axis countries were scrapped. aid to europe and japan was designed to rebuild productivity and export capacity. in the long run it was expected that such european and japanese recovery would benefit the united states by widening markets for u.s. exports and providing locations for u.s. capital expansion..in  roosevelt and churchill prepared the postwar era by negotiating with joseph stalin at yalta about respective zones of influence this same year germany was divided into four occupation zones soviet american british and french..roosevelt and henry morgenthau insisted that the big five united states united kingdom france the soviet union and china participate in the bretton woods conference in  but their plans were frustrated when the soviet union would not join the imf. the reasons why the soviet union chose not to subscribe to the articles by december  have been the subject of speculation..facing the soviet union whose power had also strengthened and whose territorial influence had expanded the u.s. assumed the role of leader of the capitalist camp. the rise of the postwar u.s. as the worlds leading industrial monetary and military power was rooted in the fact that the mainland u.s. was untouched by the war in the instability of the nation states of postwar europe and the wartime devastation of the soviet and european economies..despite the economic cost implied by such a policy being at the center of the international market gave the u.s. unprecedented freedom of action in pursuing its foreign affairs goals. a trade surplus made it easier to keep armies abroad and to invest outside the u.s. and because other countries could not sustain foreign deployments the u.s. had the power to decide why when and how to intervene in global crises. the dollar continued to function as a compass to guide the health of the world economy and exporting to the u.s. became the primary economic goal of developing or redeveloping economies. this arrangement came to be referred to as the pax americana in analogy to the pax britannica of the late th century the pax francica of the th centuries the pax hispanica of the th century and the pax romana of the first. see globalism.after the end of world war ii the u.s. held  billion in gold reserves of an estimated total of  billion approx . as world trade increased rapidly through the s the size of the gold base increased by only a few percentage points. in  the u.s. balance of payments swung negative. the first u.s. response to the crisis was in the late s when the eisenhower administration placed import quotas on oil and other restrictions on trade outflows. more drastic measures were proposed but not acted upon. however with a mounting recession that began in  this response alone was not sustainable. in  with kennedys election a decadelong effort to maintain the bretton woods system at the ounce price began..the design of the bretton woods system was such that countries could only enforce convertibility to gold for the anchor currencythe united states dollar. conversion of dollars to gold was allowed but was not required. governments could forgo converting dollars to gold and instead hold dollars. rather than full convertibility the system provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. however there was still an open gold market. for the bretton woods system to remain workable it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold or it would have to maintain the free market price for gold near the  per ounce official price. the greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the bretton woods price and selling it on the open market..in  robert triffin a belgianamerican economist noticed that holding dollars was more valuable than gold because constant u.s. balance of payments deficits helped to keep the system liquid and fuel economic growth. what would later come to be known as triffins dilemma was predicted when triffin noted that if the u.s. failed to keep running deficits the system would lose its liquidity not be able to keep up with the worlds economic growth and thus bring the system to a halt. but incurring such payment deficits also meant that over time the deficits would erode confidence in the dollar as the reserve currency created instability..the first effort was the creation of the london gold pool on  november  between eight governments. the theory behind the pool was that spikes in the free market price of gold set by the morning gold fix in london could be controlled by having a pool of gold to sell on the open market that would then be recovered when the price of gold dropped. golds price spiked in response to events such as the cuban missile crisis and other less significant events to as high as ounce. the kennedy administration drafted a radical change of the tax system to spur more production capacity and thus encourage exports. this culminated with the  tax cut program designed to maintain the  peg..in  there was an attack on the pound and a run on gold in the sterling area and on  november  the british government was forced to devalue the pound. u.s. president lyndon baines johnson was faced with a difficult choice either institute protectionist measures including travel taxes export subsidies and slashing the budgetor accept the risk of a run on gold and the dollar. from johnsons perspective the world supply of gold is insufficient to make the present system workableparticularly as the use of the dollar as a reserve currency is essential to create the required international liquidity to sustain world trade and growth..while west germany agreed not to purchase gold from the u.s. and agreed to hold dollars instead the pressure on both the dollar and the pound sterling continued. in january  johnson imposed a series of measures designed to end gold outflow and to increase u.s. exports. this was unsuccessful however as in midmarch  a dollar run on gold ensued through the free market in london the london gold pool was dissolved initially by the institution of ad hoc uk bank holidays at the request of the u.s. government. this was followed by a full closure of the london gold market also at the request of the u.s. government until a series of meetings were held that attempted to rescue or reform the existing system..all attempts to maintain the peg collapsed in november  and a new policy program attempted to convert the bretton woods system into an enforcement mechanism of floating the gold peg which would be set by either fiat policy or by a restriction to honor foreign accounts. the collapse of the gold pool and the refusal of the pool members to trade gold with private entitieson  march  the congress of the united states repealed the  requirement of gold backing of the dollaras well as the u.s. pledge to suspend gold sales to governments that trade in the private markets led to the expansion of the private markets for international gold trade in which the price of gold rose much higher than the official dollar price.u.s. gold reserves remained depleted due to the actions of some countries notably france which continued to build up their own gold reserves..in the s and s important structural changes eventually led to the breakdown of international monetary management. one change was the development of a high level of monetary interdependence. the stage was set for monetary interdependence by the return to convertibility of the western european currencies at the end of  and of the japanese yen in . convertibility facilitated the vast expansion of international financial transactions which deepened monetary interdependence..the eurodollar market grew from zero before  to  billion in . euromarkets increased international credit liquidity and volatility. capital flows began to dwarf domestic and international efforts to regulate capital movements..another aspect of the internationalization of banking has been the emergence of international banking consortia. since  various banks had formed international syndicates and by  over threequarters of the worlds largest banks had become shareholders in such syndicates. multinational banks can and do make large international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations..these new forms of monetary interdependence made large capital flows possible. during the bretton woods era countries were reluctant to alter exchange rates formally even in cases of structural disequilibria. because such changes had a direct impact on certain domestic economic groups they came to be seen as political risks for leaders. as a result official exchange rates often became unrealistic in market terms providing a virtually riskfree temptation for speculators. they could move from a weak to a strong currency hoping to reap profits when a revaluation occurred. if however monetary authorities managed to avoid revaluation they could return to other currencies with no loss. the combination of riskfree speculation with the availability of large sums was highly destabilizing..a second structural change that undermined monetary management was the decline of u.s. hegemony. the u.s. was no longer the dominant economic power it had been for more than two decades. by the mids the e.e.c. and japan had become international economic powers in their own right. with total reserves exceeding those of the u.s. higher levels of growth and trade and per capita income approaching that of the u.s. europe and japan were narrowing the gap between themselves and the united states..the shift toward a more pluralistic distribution of economic power led to increasing dissatisfaction with the privileged role of the u.s. dollar as the international currency. acting effectively as the worlds central banker the u.s. through its deficit determined the level of international liquidity. in an increasingly interdependent world u.s. policy significantly influenced economic conditions in europe and japan. in addition as long as other countries were willing to hold dollars the u.s. could carry out massive foreign expenditures for political purposesmilitary activities and foreign aidwithout the threat of balanceofpayments constraints..dissatisfaction with the political implications of the dollar system was increased by dtente between the u.s. and the soviet union. the soviet military threat had been an important force in cementing the u.s.led monetary system. the u.s. political and security umbrella helped make american economic domination palatable for europe and japan which had been economically exhausted by the war. as gross domestic production grew in european countries trade grew. when common security tensions lessened this loosened the transatlantic dependence on defence concerns and allowed latent economic tensions to surface..reinforcing the relative decline in u.s. power and the dissatisfaction of europe and japan with the system was the continuing decline of the dollarthe foundation that had underpinned the post global trading system. the vietnam war and the refusal of the administration of u.s. president lyndon b. johnson to pay for it and its great society programs through taxation resulted in an increased dollar outflow to pay for the military expenditures and rampant inflation which led to the deterioration of the u.s. balance of trade position. in the late s the dollar was overvalued with its current trading position while the german mark and the yen were undervalued and naturally the germans and the japanese had no desire to revalue and thereby make their exports more expensive whereas the u.s. sought to maintain its international credibility by avoiding devaluation. meanwhile the pressure on government reserves was intensified by the new international currency markets with their vast pools of speculative capital moving around in search of quick profits..in contrast upon the creation of bretton woods with the u.s. producing half of the worlds manufactured goods and holding half its reserves the twin burdens of international management and the cold war were possible to meet at first. throughout the s washington sustained a balance of payments deficit to finance loans aid and troops for allied regimes. but during the s the costs of doing so became less tolerable. by  the u.s. held under  of international reserves. adjustment to these changed realities was impeded by the u.s. commitment to fixed exchange rates and by the u.s. obligation to convert dollars into gold on demand..by  the attempt to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of ounce the policy of the eisenhower kennedy and johnson administrations had become increasingly untenable. gold outflows from the u.s. accelerated and despite gaining assurances from germany and other countries to hold gold the unbalanced spending of the johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the s and s into a dollar glut by the s. in  the imf agreed in rio de janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in . special drawing rights sdrs were set as equal to one u.s. dollar but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the imf. governments were required to accept holding sdrs equal to three times their allotment and interest would be charged or credited to each nation based on their sdr holding. the original interest rate was ...the intent of the sdr system was to prevent countries from buying pegged gold and selling it at the higher free market price and give governments a reason to hold dollars by crediting interest at the same time setting a clear limit to the amount of dollars that could be held..a negative balance of payments growing public debt incurred by the vietnam war and great society programs and monetary inflation by the federal reserve caused the dollar to become increasingly overvalued. the drain on u.s. gold reserves culminated with the london gold pool collapse in march . by  the u.s. had seen its gold coverage deteriorate from  to . this in the view of neoclassical economists represented the point where holders of the dollar had lost faith in the ability of the u.s. to cut budget and trade deficits..in  more and more dollars were being printed in washington then being pumped overseas to pay for government expenditure on the military and social programs. in the first six months of  assets for  billion fled the u.s. in response on  august  nixon issued executive order  pursuant to the economic stabilization act of  unilaterally imposing day wage and price controls a  import surcharge and most importantly closed the gold window making the dollar inconvertible to gold directly except on the open market. unusually this decision was made without consulting members of the international monetary system or even his own state department and was soon dubbed the nixon shock..the august shock was followed by efforts under u.s. leadership to reform the international monetary system. throughout the fall autumn of  a series of multilateral and bilateral negotiations between the group of ten countries took place seeking to redesign the exchange rate regime..meeting in december  at the smithsonian institution in washington d.c. the group of ten signed the smithsonian agreement. the u.s. pledged to peg the dollar at ounce with . trading bands and other countries agreed to appreciate their currencies versus the dollar. the group also planned to balance the world financial system using special drawing rights alone..the agreement failed to encourage discipline by the federal reserve or the united states government. the federal reserve was concerned about an increase in the domestic unemployment rate due to the devaluation of the dollar. in an attempt to undermine the efforts of the smithsonian agreement the federal reserve lowered interest rates in pursuit of a previously established domestic policy objective of full national employment. with the smithsonian agreement member countries anticipated a return flow of dollars to the u.s. but the reduced interest rates within the united states caused dollars to continue to flow out of the u.s. and into foreign central banks. the inflow of dollars into foreign banks continued the monetization of the dollar overseas defeating the aims of the smithsonian agreement. as a result the dollar price in the gold free market continued to cause pressure on its official rate soon after a  devaluation was announced in february  japan and the eec countries decided to let their currencies float. this proved to be the beginning of the collapse of the bretton woods system. the end of bretton woods was formally ratified by the jamaica accords in . by the early s all industrialised states were using floating currencies..during the  financial crisis some policymakers such as james chace and others called for a new international monetary system that some of them also dub bretton woods ii..on  september  french president nicolas sarkozy said we must rethink the financial system from scratch as at bretton woods..in march  prime minister papandreou of greece wrote an oped in the international herald tribune in which he said democratic governments worldwide must establish a new global financial architecture as bold in its own way as bretton woods as bold as the creation of the european community and european monetary union. and we need it fast. in interviews coinciding with his meeting with president obama he indicated that obama would raise the issue of new regulations for the international financial markets at the next g meetings in june and november ..over the course of the crisis the imf progressively relaxed its stance on freemarket principles such as its guidance against using capital controls. in  the imfs managing director dominique strausskahn stated that boosting employment and equity must be placed at the heart of the imfs policy agenda. the world bank indicated a switch towards greater emphases on job creation..following the  economic recession the managing director of the imf announced the emergence of a new bretton woods moment which outlines the need for coordinated fiscal response on the part of central banks around the world to address the ongoing economic crisis..the bretton woods system played a key role in shaping the postwar global economy but its structure also led to significant challenges. while it initially provided monetary stability and facilitated economic growth it placed a heavy reliance on the u.s. dollar as the central reserve currency. this gave the united states considerable influence over the international financial system and allowed it to run persistent trade and budget deficits with fewer immediate consequences than other nations. fixed exchange rates a defining feature of the system provided stability but also limited the flexibility of national governments to respond to economic shifts sometimes leading to economic strain..as global trade expanded maintaining the system became increasingly difficult. rising inflation and growing u.s. trade deficits in the s created tensions particularly among european nations and japan which sought more control over their monetary policies. the systems collapse in the early s led to the widespread adoption of floating exchange rates marking a significant shift in global finance. the institutions created under bretton woods particularly the international monetary fund imf and the world bank have also been the subject of ongoing debate. critics argue that these institutions while intended to promote global financial stability and development have often imposed loan conditions that disproportionately burden developing nations. the world bank has faced scrutiny for funding projects linked to environmental and social disruptions while the imf has been criticized for enforcing austerity measures that some argue have deepened economic crises rather than alleviated them. critics also note that the imf prioritizes the stability of financial institutions over individual economic freedoms restricting the ability of local markets to selfcorrect and develop organically..the systems collapse also contributed to broader discussions on alternative monetary arrangements. some economists and policymakers have advocated for a return to a commoditybacked system while others have proposed a global reserve currency independent of any single nation similar to keynes earlier concept of the bancor. more recently decentralized financial systems including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been suggested as alternatives to governmentcontrolled monetary systems with proponents arguing that they offer a way to reduce reliance on centralized institutions. while no single system has replaced bretton woods its legacy continues to shape debates over global financial stability and monetary policy..dates are those when the rate was introduced  indicates floating rate mostly taken prior to the introduction of the euro

late  to mid the most severe downturn since the  wall street crash and great depression. the causes of the  crisis included predatory lending in the form of subprime mortgages and a resulting u.s. housing bubble excessive risktaking by global financial institutions and lack of regulatory oversight. the first phase of the crisis began in early  as mortgagebacked securities mbs tied to u.s. real estate and a vast web of derivatives linked to those mbs collapsed in value. a liquidity crisis spread to global institutions by mid and climaxed with the bankruptcy of lehman brothers in september  which triggered a stock market crash and international banking crisis..during the s the u.s. congress had passed legislation that intended to expand affordable housing through looser financing rules and in  parts of the  banking act glasssteagall act were repealed enabling institutions to mix lowrisk operations such as commercial banking and insurance with higherrisk operations such as investment banking and proprietary trading. as the federal reserve fed lowered the federal funds rate from  to  institutions increasingly targeted lowincome homebuyers largely belonging to racial minorities with highrisk loans this development went unattended by regulators. as interest rates rose from  to  the cost of mortgages rose and the demand for housing fell in early  as more u.s. subprime mortgage holders began defaulting on their repayments lenders went bankrupt culminating in the bankruptcy of new century financial in april. as demand and prices continued to fall the financial contagion spread to global credit markets by august  and central banks began injecting liquidity. in march  bear stearns the fifth largest u.s. investment bank was sold to jpmorgan chase in a fire sale backed by fed financing..in response to the growing crisis governments around the world deployed massive bailouts of financial institutions and other monetary and fiscal policies to prevent a collapse of the global financial system. by july  fannie mae and freddie mac companies which together owned or guaranteed half of the u.s. housing market verged on collapse the housing and economic recovery act of  enabled the federal government to seize them on september . lehman brothers the fourth largest u.s. investment bank filed for the largest bankruptcy in u.s. history on september  which was followed by a fed bailout of american international group the countrys largest insurer the next day and the seizure of washington mutual in the largest bank failure in u.s. history on september . on october  congress passed the emergency economic stabilization act authorizing the treasury department to purchase toxic assets and bank stocks through the  billion troubled asset relief program tarp. the fed began a program of quantitative easing by buying treasury bonds and other assets such as mbs and the american recovery and reinvestment act signed in february  by newly elected president barack obama included a range of measures intended to preserve existing jobs and create new ones. these initiatives combined coupled with actions taken in other countries ended the worst of the great recession by mid..assessments of the crisiss impact in the u.s. vary but suggest that some . million jobs were lost causing unemployment to rise from  percent in  to a high of  percent in october . the percentage of citizens living in poverty rose from . percent in  to . percent in . the dow jones industrial average fell by  percent between october  and march  and some estimates suggest that one in four households lost  percent or more of their net worth. in  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was passed overhauling financial regulations. it was opposed by many republicans and it was weakened by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act in . the basel iii capital and liquidity standards were also adopted by countries around the world. the recession was a significant factor in the european debt crisis of the s..the crisis sparked the great recession which at the time was the most severe global recession since the great depression. it was also followed by the european debt crisis which began with a deficit in greece in late  and the  icelandic financial crisis which involved the bank failure of all three of the major banks in iceland and relative to the size of its economy was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history. it was among the five worst financial crises the world had experienced and led to a loss of more than  trillion from the global economy. u.s. home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of  during the s to  during  reaching . .trillion in  trillion. the increase in cash out refinancings as home values rose fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined. many financial institutions owned investments whose value was based on home mortgages such as mortgagebacked securities or credit derivatives used to insure them against failure which declined in value significantly. the international monetary fund estimated that large u.s. and european banks lost more than  trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from january  to september ..lack of investor confidence in bank solvency and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and commodity prices in late  and early . the crisis rapidly spread into a global economic shock resulting in several bank failures. economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined. housing markets suffered and unemployment soared resulting in evictions and foreclosures. several businesses failed. from its peak in the second quarter of  at . trillion household wealth in the united states fell  trillion to . trillion by the end of the first quarter of  resulting in a decline in consumption then a decline in business investment. in the fourth quarter of  the quarteroverquarter decline in real gdp in the u.s. was .. the u.s. unemployment rate peaked at . in october  the highest rate since  and roughly twice the precrisis rate. the average hours per work week declined to  the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in ..the economic crisis started in the u.s. but spread to the rest of the world. u.s. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between  and  and the rest of the world depended on the u.s. consumer as a source of demand. toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally. derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. the deleveraging of financial institutions as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade. reductions in the growth rates of developing countries were due to falls in trade commodity prices investment and remittances sent from migrant workers example armenia. states with fragile political systems feared that investors from western states would withdraw their money because of the crisis..as part of national fiscal policy response to the great recession governments and central banks including the federal reserve the european central bank and the bank of england provided thenunprecedented trillions of dollars in bailouts and stimulus including expansive fiscal policy and monetary policy to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity avoid a further collapse encourage lending restore faith in the integral commercial paper markets avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals. in effect the central banks went from being the lender of last resort to the lender of only resort for a significant portion of the economy. in some cases the fed was considered the buyer of last resort. during the fourth quarter of  these central banks purchased us. .trillion in  trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. this was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market and the largest monetary policy action in world history. following a model initiated by the  united kingdom bank rescue package the governments of european nations and the united states guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems ultimately purchasing . trillion newly issued preferred stock in major banks. the federal reserve created thensignificant amounts of new currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap..bailouts came in the form of trillions of dollars of loans asset purchases guarantees and direct spending. significant controversy accompanied the bailouts such as in the case of the aig bonus payments controversy leading to the development of a variety of decision making frameworks to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis. alistair darling the u.k.s chancellor of the exchequer at the time of the crisis stated in  that britain came within hours of a breakdown of law and order the day that royal bank of scotland was bailedout. instead of financing more domestic loans some banks instead spent some of the stimulus money in more profitable areas such as investing in emerging markets and foreign currencies..in july  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in the united states to promote the financial stability of the united states. the basel iii capital and liquidity standards were adopted worldwide. since the  financial crisis consumer regulators in america have more closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages in order to deter anticompetitive practices that led to the crisis..at least two major reports on the causes of the crisis were produced by the u.s. congress the financial crisis inquiry commission report released january  and a report by the united states senate homeland security permanent subcommittee on investigations entitled wall street and the financial crisis anatomy of a financial collapse released april ..in total  bankers served jail time as a result of the crisis over half of which were from iceland where the crisis was the most severe and led to the collapse of all three major icelandic banks. in april  geir haarde of iceland became the only politician to be convicted as a result of the crisis. only one banker in the united states served jail time as a result of the crisis kareem serageldin a banker at credit suisse who was sentenced to  months in jail and returned . million in compensation for manipulating bond prices to hide  billion of losses. no individuals in the united kingdom were convicted as a result of the crisis. goldman sachs paid  million to settle fraud charges after allegedly anticipating the crisis and selling toxic investments to its clients..with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction the number of patent applications was flat compared to exponential increases in patent application in prior years..typical american families did not fare well nor did the wealthybutnotwealthiest families just beneath the pyramids top. however half of the poorest families in the united states did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis because they generally did not own financial investments whose value could fluctuate. the federal reserve surveyed  households from  to  and found that the total wealth of  of all americans declined in that period and  of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth while only  of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease..the following is a timeline of the major events of the financial crisis including government responses and the subsequent economic recovery..there is a really good reason for tighter credit. tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression. this matters for credit decisions. a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car andor have a default placed on their credit record. on the other hand a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. in the case of businesses their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. profit prospects look much worse in november  than they did in november ... while many banks are obviously at the brink consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. the problem with the economy is the loss of close to  trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth.....the pace of economic contraction is slowing. conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses lower housing wealth and tight credit. businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions fiscal and monetary stimulus and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability..in the table the names of emerging and developing economies are shown in boldface type while the names of developed economies are in roman regular type..the twenty largest economies contributing to global gdp ppp growth .the expansion of central bank lending in response to the crisis was not confined to the federal reserves provision of aid to individual financial institutions. the federal reserve has also conducted several innovative lending programs to improve liquidity and strengthen different financial institutions and markets such as freddie mac and fannie mae. in this case the major problem in the market is the lack of free cash reserves and flows to secure the loans. the federal reserve took many steps to deal with financial market liquidity worries. one of these steps was a credit line for major traders who act as the feds partners in open market activities. also loan programs were set up to make the money market mutual funds and commercial paper market more flexible. also the term assetbacked securities loan facility talf was put in place thanks to a joint effort with the us department of the treasury. this plan made it easier for consumers and businesses to get credit by giving americans who owned highquality assetbacked securities more credit..before the crisis the federal reserves stocks of treasury securities were sold to pay for the increase in credit. this method was meant to keep banks from trying to give out their extra savings which could cause the federal funds rate to drop below where it was supposed to be. however in october  the federal reserve was granted the power to provide banks with interest payments on their surplus reserves. this created a motivation for banks to retain their reserves instead of disbursing them thus reducing the need for the federal reserve to hedge its increased lending by decreases in alternative assets..money market funds also went through runs when people lost faith in the market. to keep it from getting worse the fed said it would give money to mutual fund companies. also department of treasury said that it would briefly cover the assets of the fund. both of these things helped get the fund market back to normal which helped the commercial paper market which most businesses use to run. the fdic also did several things such as raising the insurance cap from  to  to boost customer trust..they engaged in quantitative easing which added more than  trillion to the financial system and got banks to start lending again both to each other and to people. many homeowners who were trying to keep their homes from going into default got housing credits. a package of policies was passed that let borrowers refinance their loans even though the value of their homes was less than what they still owed on their mortgages..while the causes of the bubble and subsequent crash are disputed the precipitating factor for the financial crisis of  was the bursting of the united states housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of mortgage loans particularly adjustablerate mortgages. some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis.the relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in subprime lending. subprime had not become less risky wall street just accepted this higher risk..due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers. in the view of some analysts the relatively conservative governmentsponsored enterprises gses policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to . however as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. the riskiest loans were originated in  the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses. the gses eventually relaxed their standards to try to catch up with the private banks..a contrarian view is that fannie mae and freddie mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards starting in  by advocating the use of easytoqualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems by designing nodownpayment products issued by lenders by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as countrywide..depending on how subprime mortgages are defined they remained below  of all mortgage originations until  when they rose to nearly  and remained there through the  peak of the united states housing bubble..the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission written by the six democratic appointees the minority report written by three of the four republican appointees studies by federal reserve economists and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis. although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios..in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission conservative american enterprise institute fellow peter j. wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the united states department of housing and urban development hud in the s and to massive risky loan purchases by governmentsponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac. based upon information in the secs december  securities fraud case against six former executives of fannie and freddie peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that in  fannie and freddie held  million substandard loans totaling over  trillion..in the early and mids the bush administration called numerous times for investigations into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages. on september   the united states house committee on financial services held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities. the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation. some such as wallison believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the u.s. financial system that went unheeded..a  united states department of the treasury study of lending trends for  cities from  to  showed that  billion of mortgage lending was made by community reinvestment act cracovered lenders into low and midlevel income lmi borrowers and neighborhoods representing  of all u.s. mortgage lending during the period. the majority of these were prime loans. subprime loans made by cracovered institutions constituted a  market share of lmi loans in  but in the runup to the crisis fully  of all subprime lending occurred at cracovered institutions and another  of subprime loans had some connection with cra. however most subprime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra especially in the years  leading up to the crisis nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up subprime lending..to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes in  and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising and does not exonerate the cra. they contend that there were two connected causes to the crisis the relaxation of underwriting standards in  and the ultralow interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september  . both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place. critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive totaling . trillion in the years between  and . they also argue that the federal reserves classification of cra loans as prime is based on the faulty and selfserving assumption that highinterestrate loans  percentage points over average equal subprime loans..others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. in an article in portfolio magazine michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that there werent enough americans with  credit taking out  to satisfy investors appetite for the end product. essentially investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans using derivatives called credit default swaps collateralized debt obligations and synthetic cdos..by march  the fdic had paid out  billion c.billion in  to cover losses on bad loans at  failed financial institutions. the congressional budget office estimated in june  that the bailout to fannie mae and freddie mac exceeds  billion c.billion in  calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time..economist paul krugman argued in january  that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that fannie mae freddie mac cra or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. in other words bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes..countering krugman wallison wrote it is not true that every bubbleeven a large bubblehas the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates. wallison notes that other developed countries had large bubbles during the  period but the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the   deflated. according to wallison the reason the u.s. residential housing bubble as opposed to other types of bubbles led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loansgenerally with low or no downpayments..krugmans contention that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that u.s. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis is challenged by additional analysis. after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis xudong an and anthony b. sanders reported in december  we find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in cmbs  loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis. other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate. business journalist kimberly amadeo reported the first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in . three years later commercial real estate started feeling the effects. denice a. gierach a real estate attorney and cpa wrote....most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy. in other words the borrowers did not cause the loans to go badit was the economy..between  and  the price of the typical american house increased by . during the s and s the national median home price ranged from . to . times median household income. by contrast this ratio increased to . in  and . in . this housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation..in a peabody awardwinning program npr correspondents argued that a giant pool of money represented by  trillion in worldwide fixed income investments sought higher yields than those offered by u.s. treasury bonds early in the decade. this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from  to  yet the supply of relatively safe income generating investments had not grown as fast. investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgagebacked security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies..in effect wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the us with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. by approximately  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards..the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority. those securities first in line received investmentgrade ratings from rating agencies. securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested..by september  average u.s. housing prices had declined by over  from their mid peak. as prices declined borrowers with adjustablerate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default. during  lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly . million properties a  increase over . this increased to . million in  an  increase vs. . by august  approximately  of all u.s. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure. by september  this had risen to ...after the bubble burst australian economist john quiggin wrote and unlike the great depression this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets. there was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the s the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations or the smoothawley tariff all of which have shared the blame for the great depression. instead quiggin lays the blame for the  nearmeltdown on financial markets on political decisions to lightly regulate them and on rating agencies which had selfinterested incentives to give good ratings..lower interest rates encouraged borrowing. from  to  the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from . to .. this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dotcom bubble and the september  attacks as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation. as early as  it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble. moreover empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis..additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by rising u.s. current account deficit which peaked along with the housing bubble in . federal reserve chairman ben bernanke explained how trade deficits required the u.s. to borrow money from abroad in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates..bernanke explained that between  and  the u.s. current account deficit increased by  billion from . to . of gdp. financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad much of it from countries running trade surpluses. these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oilexporting nations. the balance of payments identity requires that a country such as the us running a current account deficit also have a capital account investment surplus of the same amount. hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds capital flowed into the u.s. to finance its imports..all of this created demand for various types of financial assets raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates as high as  in china or because of high oil prices. ben bernanke referred to this as a saving glut..a flood of funds capital or liquidity reached the u.s. financial markets. foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis. u.s. households used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgagebacked securities..the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july  and july . this contributed to an increase in oneyear and fiveyear adjustablerate mortgage arm rates making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners. this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates and it became riskier to speculate in housing. u.s. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst..subprime lending standards declined in the u.s. in early  a subprime borrower had a fico score of  or less. by  many lenders dropped the required fico score to  making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. proof of income and assets were deemphasized. loans at first required full documentation then low documentation then no documentation. one subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income no job no asset verification required ninja mortgage. informally these loans were aptly referred to as liar loans because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process. testimony given to the financial crisis inquiry commission by whistleblower richard m. bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for citigroup where he was responsible for over  professional underwriters suggests that by  and  the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic. his testimony stated that by   of mortgages purchased by citigroup from some  mortgage companies were defective were not underwritten to policy or did not contain all policyrequired documentsthis despite the fact that each of these  originators was contractually responsible certified via representations and warrantees that its mortgage originations met citigroup standards. moreover during  defective mortgages from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to citis standards increased... to over  of production..in separate testimony to the financial crisis inquiry commission officers of clayton holdings the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europe testified that claytons review of over  mortgages issued from january  to june  revealed that scarcely  of the loans met their originators underwriting standards. the analysis conducted on behalf of  investment and commercial banks including  too big to fail banks additionally showed that  of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. claytons analysis further showed that  of these loans i.e. those not meeting any issuers minimal underwriting standards were subsequently securitized and sold to investors..predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders enticing borrowers to enter into unsafe or unsound secured loans for inappropriate purposes..in june  countrywide financial was sued by then california attorney general jerry brown for unfair business practices and false advertising alleging that countrywide used deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated risky and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to thirdparty investors. in may  bank of america modified  countrywide loans as a result. when housing prices decreased homeowners in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments since their home equity had disappeared. this caused countrywides financial condition to deteriorate ultimately resulting in a decision by the office of thrift supervision to seize the lender. one countrywide employeewho would later plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud and spent  months in prisonstated that if you had a pulse we gave you a loan..former employees from ameriquest which was united states leading wholesale lender described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to wall street banks eager to make fast profits. there is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis..according to barry eichengreen the roots of the financial crisis lay in the deregulation of financial markets. a  oecd study suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. in other cases laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. key examples include.a  paper suggested that canadas avoidance of a banking crisis in  as well as in prior eras could be attributed to canada possessing a single powerful overarching regulator while the united states had a weak crisis prone and fragmented banking system with multiple competing regulatory bodies..prior to the crisis financial institutions became highly leveraged increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as offbalance sheet securitization and derivatives which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels..u.s. households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis. this increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn. key statistics include.free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from  billion in  to  billion in  as the housing bubble built a total of nearly  trillion over the period contributing to economic growth worldwide. u.s. home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of  during the s to  during  reaching . trillion c..trillion in ..u.s. household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was  at the end of  versus  in . in  u.s. private debt was  of gdp by the third quarter of  it was ..from  to  the top five u.s. investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock. changes in capital requirements intended to keep u.s. banks competitive with their european counterparts allowed lower risk weightings for aaarated securities. the shift from firstloss tranches to aaarated tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage. these five institutions reported over . trillion in debt for fiscal year  about  of u.s. nominal gdp for . lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at firesale prices and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation. with the exception of lehman these companies required or received government support..fannie mae and freddie mac two u.s. governmentsponsored enterprises owned or guaranteed nearly  trillion c..trillion in  trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the u.s. government in september ..these seven entities were highly leveraged and had  trillion in debt or guarantee obligations yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks..behavior that may be optimal for an individual such as saving more during adverse economic conditions can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior as ultimately one persons consumption is another persons income. too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. economist hyman minsky also described a paradox of deleveraging as financial institutions that have too much leverage debt relative to equity cannot all deleverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets..in april  federal reserve vicechair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes.once this massive credit crunch hit it didnt take long before we were in a recession. the recession in turn deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell and credit losses of financial institutions surged. indeed we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. consumers are pulling back on purchases especially on durable goods to build their savings. businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. and financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. once again minsky understood this dynamic. he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firmsand indeed essential to return the economy to a normal statenevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole..the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives such as offsetting a particular risk exposure such as the default of a borrower or to assist with obtaining financing. examples pertinent to this crisis included the adjustablerate mortgage the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgagebacked securities mbs or collateralized debt obligations cdo for sale to investors a type of securitization and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps cds. the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions..cdo issuance grew from an estimated  billion in q  to its peak of over  billion by q  then declined back under  billion by q . further the credit quality of cdos declined from  to  as the level of subprime and other nonprime mortgage debt increased from  to  of cdo assets. as described in the section on subprime lending the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. for example buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo when those cdos became worthless..this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage including mortgage brokers specialized originators the securitizers and their due diligence firms managing agents and trading desks and finally investors insurances and providers of repo funding. with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information including fico scores on creditworthiness appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks. instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts misjudgments and finally market collapse. economists have studied the crisis as an instance of cascades in financial networks where institutions instability destabilized other institutions and led to knockon effects..martin wolf chief economics commentator at the financial times wrote in june  that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations such as offbalance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks stating an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decadethe offbalancesheet vehicles the derivatives and the shadow banking system itselfwas to find a way round regulation..mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past  years. limitations of default and prepayment models the heart of pricing models led to overvaluation of mortgage and assetbacked products and their derivatives by originators securitizers brokerdealers ratingagencies insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors with the exception of certain hedge funds. while financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk..for a variety of reasons market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system. the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. banks estimated that  billion of cdo were sold between late  to the middle of  among the  billion of those that had been liquidated jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for high quality cdos was approximately  cents on the dollar while the recovery rate for mezzanine capital cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar..aig insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted. however aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september . u.s. taxpayers provided over  billion in government loans and investments in aig during  and early  through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions including many large global financial institutions..the financial crisis inquiry commission fcic made the major government study of the crisis. it concluded in january .the commission concludes aig failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral setting aside capital reserves or hedging its exposurea profound failure in corporate governance particularly its risk management practices. aigs failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of overthecounter otc derivatives including credit default swaps which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of aigs failure..the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood. this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgagebacked securities. because it was highly tractable it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors issuers and rating agencies. according to one wired article.then the model fell apart. cracks started appearing early on when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of lis formula hadnt expected. the cracks became fullfledged canyons in when ruptures in the financial systems foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril... lis gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees. .as financial assets became more complex and harder to value investors were reassured by the fact that the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were. george soros commented that the superboom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. similarly the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products. it was a shocking abdication of responsibility..a conflict of interest between investment management professional and institutional investors combined with a global glut in investment capital led to bad investments by asset managers in overpriced credit assets. professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. there is therefore an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. many asset managers continued to invest client funds in overpriced underyielding investments to the detriment of their clients so they could maintain their assets under management. they supported this choice with a plausible deniability of the risks associated with subprimebased credit assets because the loss experience with early vintages of subprime loans was so low..despite the dominance of the above formula there are documented attempts of the financial industry occurring before the crisis to address the formula limitations specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events. the volume credit correlation life after copulas published in  by world scientific summarizes a  conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations. see also the article by donnelly and embrechts and the book by brigo pallavicini and torresetti that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in ..there is strong evidence that the riskiest worst performing mortgages were funded through the shadow banking system and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans..in a june  speech president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of new york timothy geithnerwho in  became united states secretary of the treasuryplaced significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a run on the entities in the parallel banking system also called the shadow banking system. these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. further these entities were vulnerable because of assetliability mismatch meaning that they borrowed shortterm in liquid markets to purchase longterm illiquid and risky assets. this meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging selling their longterm assets at depressed prices. he described the significance of these entities.in early  assetbacked commercial paper conduits in structured investment vehicles in auctionrate preferred securities tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes had a combined asset size of roughly . trillion. assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to . trillion. assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly . trillion. the combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled  trillion. in comparison the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over  trillion and total assets of the entire banking system were about  trillion. the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to selfreinforcing asset price and credit cycles..economist paul krugman laureate of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences described the run on the shadow banking system as the core of what happened to cause the crisis. he referred to this lack of controls as malign neglect and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all bankinglike activity. without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgagebacked securities or assetbacked commercial paper investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations..this meant that nearly onethird of the u.s. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june . according to the brookings institution at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume. the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization were likely to vanish forever having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions. while traditional banks raised their lending standards it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing..in a  paper ricardo j. caballero emmanuel farhi and pierreolivier gourinchas argued that the financial crisis was attributable to global asset scarcity which led to large capital flows toward the united states and to the creation of asset bubbles that eventually burst. caballero farhi and gourinchas argued that the sharp rise in oil prices following the subprime crisis  nearly  percent in just a matter of months and on the face of recessionary shocks  was the result of a speculative response to the financial crisis itself in an attempt to rebuild asset supply. that is the global economy was subject to one shock with multiple implications rather than to two separate shocks financial and oil..longonly commodity index funds became popular  by one estimate investment increased from  billion in  to  billion at the end of  while commodity prices increased   which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble. the empirical research has been mixed..the cause of the global asset bubble can be partially attributable to the global savings glut. as theorized by andrew metrick the demand for safe assets following the asian financial crisis coupled with the lack of circulating treasuries created an unmet demand for risk free assets. thus institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds began purchasing synthetic safe assets like triplea mortgage backed securities..as a consequence the demand for socalled safe assets fueled the free flow of capital into housing in the united states. this greatly worsened the crisis as banks and other financial institutions were incentivized to issue more mortgages than before..in a  book john mcmurtry suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself..in his  book the downfall of capitalism and communism ravi batra suggests that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes. he also suggested that a demand gap related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments..john bellamy foster a political economy analyst and editor of the monthly review believed that the decrease in gdp growth rates since the early s is due to increasing market saturation..marxian economics followers andrew kliman michael roberts and guglielmo carchedi in contradistinction to the monthly review school represented by foster pointed to capitalisms longterm tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. from this point of view the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets where there was potential for greater return on investment. the speculative frenzy of the late s and s was in this view a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. according to michael roberts the fall in the rate of profit eventually triggered the credit crunch of  when credit could no longer support profits..in  book the battle for the soul of capitalism john c. bogle wrote that corporate america went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long. echoing the central thesis of james burnhams  seminal book the managerial revolution bogle cites issues including.in his book the big mo mark roeder a former executive at the swissbased ubs bank suggested that largescale momentum or the big mo played a pivotal role in the financial crisis. roeder suggested that recent technological advances such as computerdriven trading programs together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets has magnified the momentum effect. this has made the financial sector inherently unstable..robert reich attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the united states particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise  of the workforce. this stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living..economists ailsa mckay and margunn bjrnholt argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession and call for a reshaping of both the economy economic theory and the economics profession..a report by the international labour organization concluded that cooperative banking institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis. the cooperative banking sector had  market share of the european banking sector but accounted for only  of all the writedowns and losses between the third quarter of  and first quarter of . in  in the u.s. the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of credit unions and almost five times the credit union rate in . credit unions increased their lending to small and mediumsized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased..economists particularly followers of mainstream economics mostly failed to predict the crisis. the wharton school of the university of pennsylvanias online business journal examined why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis and concluded that economists used mathematical models that failed to account for the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions as opposed to producers and consumers of goods and services play in the economy..several followers of heterodox economics predicted the crisis with varying arguments. dirk bezemer credits  economists with predicting the crisis dean baker us wynne godley uk fred harrison uk michael hudson us eric janszen us steve keen australia jakob broechner madsen  jens kjaer srensen denmark med jones us kurt richebcher us nouriel roubini us peter schiff us and robert shiller us..shiller a founder of the caseshiller index that measures home prices wrote an article a year before the collapse of lehman brothers in which he predicted that a slowing u.s. housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst leading to financial collapse. peter schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse..the austrian school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable creditfueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply..there were other economists that did warn of a pending crisis..the former governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in  when he became chief economist at the international monetary fund. in  at a celebration honoring alan greenspan who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector. in that paper rajan argued that disaster might loom. rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but in return offer generous compensation the rest of the time. these risks are known as tail risks. but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized..stock trader and financial risk engineer nassim nicholas taleb author of the  book the black swan spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting and framed the problem as part of robustness and fragility. he also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis they didnt listen so i took their money. according to david brooks from the new york times taleb not only has an explanation for whats happening he saw it coming..popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. for example an article in the new york times noted that economist nouriel roubini warned of such crisis as early as september  and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions. according to the guardian roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession while the new york times labelled him dr. doom..in a  article in the journal japan and the world economy andrew k. rose and mark m. spiegel used a multiple indicator multiple cause mimic model on a crosssection of  countries to evaluate potential causes of the  crisis. the authors examined various economic indicators ignoring contagion effects across countries. the authors concluded we include over sixty potential causes of the crisis covering such categories as financial system policies and conditions asset price appreciation in real estate and equity markets international imbalances and foreign reserve adequacy macroeconomic policies and institutional and geographic features. despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible causes in a flexible statistical framework we are unable to link most of the commonly cited causes of the crisis to its incidence across countries. this negative finding in the crosssection makes us skeptical of the accuracy of early warning systems of potential crises which must also predict their timing..the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern californiabased indymac a spinoff of countrywide financial. before its failure indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage loan originator in the united states. the failure of indymac bank on july   was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift. indymac banks parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank. indymac bancorp filed for chapter  bankruptcy in july ..indymac bank was founded as countrywide mortgage investment in  by david s. loeb and angelo mozilo as a means of collateralizing countrywide financial loans too big to be sold to freddie mac and fannie mae. in  countrywide spun off indymac as an independent company run by mike perry who remained its ceo until the downfall of the bank in july ..the primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing alta loans on a large scale. this strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. from its inception as a savings association in  indymac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the united states. during  indymac originated over  billion billion in  of mortgages..indymacs aggressive growth strategy use of alta and other nontraditional loan products insufficient underwriting credit concentrations in residential real estate in the california and florida marketsstates alongside nevada and arizona where the housing bubble was most pronouncedand heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a federal home loan bank fhlb and from brokered deposits led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in ..indymac often made loans without verification of the borrowers income or assets and to borrowers with poor credit histories. appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. as an alta lender indymacs business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrowers needs using an extensive array of risky optionadjustablerate mortgages option arms subprime loans  loans and other nontraditional products. ultimately loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. the thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market. indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria see the comment by ruthann melbourne chief risk officer to the regulating agencies..on may   in the capital section of its last q indymac revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future..indymac reported that during april  moodys and standard  poors downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgagebacked security mbs bondsincluding  million million in  issued by indymac that the bank retained in its mbs portfolio. indymac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed its riskbased capital ratio as of june  . had these lowered ratings been in effect on march   indymac concluded that the banks capital ratio would have been . total riskbased. indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below well capitalized minimum  riskbased capital ratio to adequately capitalized  riskbased capital ratio the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds..senator charles schumer dny later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than  of indymacs total deposits and asked the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits. with . billion in total deposits reported on march  senator schumer would have been referring to a little over  billion in brokered deposits. while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at  million a month had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june ..indymac was taking new measures to preserve capital such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of  after being cut in half the previous quarter. the company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer..indymac reported that the banks riskbased capital was only  million above the minimum required for this  mark. but it did not reveal some of that  million .million in  capital it claimed it had as of march   was fabricated..when home prices declined in the latter half of  and the secondary mortgage market collapsed indymac was forced to hold . billion .billion in  of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june  when account holders withdrew . billion .billion in  or about . of indymacs deposits. this bank run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots. the letter outlined the senators concerns with indymac. while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymacs demise the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way it was operated..on june   senator charles schumer dny a member of the senate banking committee chairman of congress joint economic committee and the thirdranking democrat in the senate released several letters he had sent to regulators in which he wasconcerned that indymacs financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers. some worried depositors began to withdraw money..on july   indymac announced on the company blog that it.indymac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions halted new loan submissions and cut  jobs..on july   citing liquidity concerns the fdic put indymac bank into conservatorship. a bridge bank indymac federal bank fsb was established to assume control of indymac banks assets its secured liabilities and its insured deposit accounts. the fdic announced plans to open indymac federal bank fsb on july  . until then depositors would have access to their insured deposits through atms their existing checks and their existing debit cards. telephone and internet account access was restored when the bank reopened. the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us and declared a special advance dividend to the roughly  depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount guaranteeing  of any amounts in excess of . yet even with the pending sale of indymac to imb management holdings an estimated  uninsured depositors of indymac are still at a loss of over  million..with  billion in assets indymac bank was one of the largest bank failures in american history..indymac bancorp filed for chapter  bankruptcy on july  ..initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as northern rock and countrywide financial as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. over  mortgage lenders went bankrupt during  and . concerns that investment bank bear stearns would collapse in march  resulted in its firesale to jp morgan chase. the financial institution crisis hit its peak in september and october . several major institutions either failed were acquired under duress or were subject to government takeover. these included lehman brothers merrill lynch fannie mae freddie mac washington mutual wachovia citigroup and aig. on october   three weeks after lehman brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in u.s. history lehmans former ceo richard s. fuld jr. found himself before representative henry a. waxman the california democrat who chaired the house committee on oversight and government reform. fuld said he was a victim of the collapse blaming a crisis of

kenya is the thmostpopulous country in the world and the th most populous in africa. kenyas capital and largest city is nairobi. its secondlargest and oldest city is mombasa a major port city located on mombasa island. other major cities within the country include kisumu nakuru  eldoret. going clockwise kenya is bordered by south sudan to the northwest though much of that border includes the disputed ilemi triangle ethiopia to the north somalia to the east the indian ocean to the southeast tanzania to the southwest and lake victoria and uganda to the west..kenyas geography climate and population vary widely. in western rift valley counties the landscape includes cold snowcapped mountaintops such as batian nelion and point lenana on mount kenya with vast surrounding forests wildlife and fertile agricultural regions to temperate climates. in other areas there are dry arid and semiarid climates as well as absolute deserts such as chalbi desert and nyiri desert. .kenyas earliest inhabitants included some of the first humans to evolve from ancestral members of the genus homo. ample fossil evidence for this evolutionary history has been found at koobi fora. later kenya was inhabited by huntergatherers similar to the presentday hadza people. according to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material cushitic speakers first settled in the regions lowlands between  and  bc a phase known as the lowland savanna pastoral neolithic. niloticspeaking pastoralists ancestral to kenyas nilotic speakers began migrating from presentday south sudan into kenya around  bc. bantu people settled at the coast and the interior between  bc and  ad..european contact began in  ad with the portuguese empire and effective colonisation of kenya began in the th century during the european exploration of africa. modernday kenya emerged from a protectorate established by the british empire in  and the subsequent kenya colony which began in . mombasa was the capital of the british east africa protectorate which included most of what is now kenya and southwestern somalia from  to . numerous disputes between the uk and the colony led to the mau mau revolution which began in  and the declaration of kenyas independence in . after independence kenya remained a member of the commonwealth of nations. the countrys current constitution was adopted in  replacing the previous  constitution..kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic in which elected officials represent the people and the president is the head of state and government. the country is a member of the united nations the commonwealth world bank international monetary fund world trade organization comesa international criminal court as well as several other international organisations. it is also a major nonnato ally of the united states..kenyas economy is the largest in east and central africa with nairobi serving as a major regional commercial hub. with a gross national income of   the country is a lowermiddleincome economy. agriculture is the countrys largest economic sector tea and coffee are the sectors traditional cash crops while fresh flowers are a fastgrowing export. the service industry particularly tourism is also one of the countrys major economic drivers. kenya is a member of the east african community trade bloc though some international trade organisations categorise it as part of the greater horn of africa. africa is kenyas largest export market followed by the european union..the republic of kenya is named after mount kenya. the earliest recorded version of the modern name was written by german explorer johann ludwig krapf in the th century. while travelling with a kamba caravan led by the longdistance trader chief kivoi krapf spotted the mountain peak and asked what it was called. kivoi told him knyaa or klma kinyaa probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded him of the feathers of the male ostrich. in archaic kikuyu the word nyaga or more commonly manyaganyaga is used to describe an extremely bright object. the agikuyu who inhabit the slopes of mt. kenya call it krma krnyaga literally the mountain with brightness in kikuyu while the embu call it kirinyaa. all three names have the same meaning..ludwig krapf recorded the name as both kenia and kegnia. some have said that this was a precise notation of the african pronunciation knj. an  map drawn by joseph thompsons a scottish geologist and naturalist indicated mt. kenya as mt. kenia. the mountains name was accepted pars pro toto as the name of the country. it did not come into widespread official use during the early colonial period when the country was referred to as the east african protectorate. the official name was changed to the colony of kenya in ..hominid species such as homo habilis fl. . to . million years ago and homo erectus fl. . million to  years ago possibly the direct ancestors of modern homo sapiens had lived in kenya in the pleistocene epoch. east africa including kenya is one of the earliest regions where modern humans homo sapiens are believed to have lived. in  during excavations at lake turkana palaeoanthropologist richard leakey assisted by kamoya kimeu had discovered the turkana boy a .millionyearold homo erectus fossil. further evidence of kenyas prehistory was found in  namely the early emergence of modern behaviours including longdistance trade networks involving goods such as obsidian the use of pigments and possibly the making of projectile points about  years ago. the authors of three  studies on the site suggest that complex and modern behaviours had already begun in africa around the time of the emergence of homo sapiens..the first inhabitants of presentday kenya were huntergatherer groups akin to the modern khoisan speakers. these people were later largely replaced by agropastoralist cushitic ancestral to kenyas cushitic speakers who originated from the horn of africa. during the early holocene the regions climate shifted from drier to wetter conditions. this provided an opportunity for the development of cultural traditions such as agriculture and herding in a more favourable environment..around  bc niloticspeaking pastoralists ancestral to kenyas presentday nilotic speakers started migrating from what is now southern sudan into kenya. today the countrys nilotic ethnic groups include the kalenjin samburu luo turkana and maasai..by the first millennium ad bantuspeaking farmers had moved into the region initially along the kenyan coast. the bantus had originated in west africa along the benue river in what is now eastern nigeria and western cameroon. the bantu migration brought new developments in agriculture and ironworking to the region. today the countrys bantu groups include the kikuyu luhya kamba kisii meru kuria aembu ambeere wadawidawatuweta wapokomo and mijikenda among many others..notable prehistoric sites in the interior of kenya include the possibly archaeoastronomical site namoratunga on the west side of lake turkana and the walled settlement of thimlich ohinga in migori county..the coastline of kenya was home to communities of ironworkers and bantu subsistence farmers hunters and fishers who supported the regions economy with agriculture fishing metal production and trade with foreign countries. these communities formed the earliest citystates in the region which were collectively known as azania. the swahili people were of mixed african and asian particularly persian ancestry as dna evidence has revealed..by the st century ce many of the areas citystates such as mombasa malindi and zanzibar began to establish trading relations with the arabs. this led to increased economic growth of the swahili states the introduction of islam arabic influences on the swahili language cultural diffusion as well as the swahili citystates becoming members of a larger trade network. many historians had long believed that the citystates were established by arab or persian traders but archaeological evidence has led scholars to recognise the citystates as an indigenous development which though subjected to foreign influence due to trade retained a bantu cultural core..the kilwa sultanate was a medieval sultanate centred at kilwa in modernday tanzania. at its height its authority stretched over the entire length of the swahili coast including kenya. beginning in the th century the rulers of kilwa would go on to build elaborate coral mosques and introduce copper coinage..swahili a bantu language with arabic persian and other middleeastern and south asian loanwords later developed as a lingua franca for trade between the different peoples. since the turn of the th century swahili has also adopted numerous loanwords and calques from english many of which originated during the era of british colonial rule..the swahili built mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby citystates as well as commercial centres in persia arabia and even india. by the th century portuguese voyager duarte barbosa wrote that mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships both of which are bound from sofala and others which come from cambay and melinde and others which sail to the island of zanzibar..one major city on the kenyan coast is malindi. it has been an important swahili settlement since the th century and the city once rivalled mombasa for dominance in the african great lakes region. malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. in  the chinese trader and explorer zheng he representing the ming dynasty visited the east african coast on one of his last treasure voyages. malindi also welcomed the portuguese explorer vasco da gama in ..in the th century the swahili coast was conquered by the omani arabs who expanded the slave trade to meet the demands of plantations in oman and zanzibar. initially these traders came mainly from oman but later many came from zanzibar such as tippu tip. in addition the portuguese started buying slaves from the omani and zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the transatlantic slave trade by british abolitionists..during the th and th century the masai people moved into the central and southern rift valley plains of kenya from a region north of lake rudolf now lake turkana. although there werent many of them they managed to conquer a great amount of land in the plains where people did not put up much resistance. the nandi peoples managed to oppose the masai while the taveta peoples fled to the forests on the eastern edge of mount kilimanjaro although they later were forced to leave the land due to the threat of smallpox. an outbreak of either rinderpest or pleuropneumonia greatly affected the masais cattle while an epidemic of smallpox affected the masai themselves. after the death of the masai mbatian the chief laibon medicine man the masai split into warring factions. the masai caused much strife in the areas they conquered however cooperation between such groups as the luo people luhya people and gusii people is evidenced by shared vocabulary for modern implements and similar economic regimes. although arab traders remained in the area trade routes were disrupted by the hostile masai though there was trade in ivory between these factions..the first foreigners to successfully get past the masai were johann ludwig krapf and johannes rebmann two german missionaries who established a mission in rabai not too far from mombasa. the pair were the first europeans to sight mount kenya..the german empire established a protectorate over the sultan of zanzibars coastal possessions in  followed by the arrival of the imperial british east africa company in . imperial rivalry was prevented by the heligolandzanzibar treaty so germany handed its east african coastal holdings to britain in ..the transfer by germany to britain was followed by the building of the uganda railway passing through the country..the building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groupsnotably the nandi led by orkoiyot koitalel arap samoei from  to but the british eventually built it. the nandi were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway..during the railway construction era there was a significant influx of indian workers who provided the bulk of the skilled labour required for construction. they and most of their descendants later remained in kenya and formed the core of several distinct indian communities such as the ismaili muslim and sikh communities. while building the railway through tsavo a number of the indian railway workers and local african labourers were attacked by two lions known as the tsavo maneaters..at the outbreak of world war i in august  the governors of british east africa as the protectorate was generally known and german east africa initially agreed on a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. but lieutenant colonel paul von lettowvorbeck the german military commander determined to tie down as many british resources as possible. completely cut off from germany lettowvorbeck conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign living off the land capturing british supplies and remaining undefeated. he eventually surrendered in northern rhodesia today zambia  days after the armistice was signed in ..to chase von lettow the british deployed the british indian army troops from india but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot. the carrier corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over  africans contributing to their longterm politicisation..in  the east africa protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed kenya after its highest mountain..during the early part of the th century the interior central highlands were settled by british and other european farmers who became wealthy farming coffee and tea. one depiction of this period of change from a colonists perspective is found in the memoir out of africa by danish author baroness karen von blixenfinecke published in . by the s approximately  white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy..the central highlands were already home to over a million members of the kikuyu people most of whom had no land claims in european terms and lived as itinerant farmers. to protect their interests the settlers banned the growing of coffee and introduced a hut tax and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. a massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to make a living from the land dwindled. by the s there were  white settlers living in kenya..throughout world war ii kenya was an important source of manpower and agriculture for the united kingdom. kenya itself was the site of fighting between allied forces and italian troops in  when italian forces invaded. wajir and malindi were bombed as well..from october  to december  kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the mau mau rebellion against british rule. the mau mau also known as the kenya land and freedom army were primarily kikuyu people. during the colonial administrations crackdown over  freedom fighters had been killed along with  british troops and  kenyan loyalist soldiers. war crimes were committed on both sides of the conflict including the publicised lari massacre and the hola massacre. the governor requested and obtained british and african troops including the kings african rifles. the british began counterinsurgency operations. in may  general sir george erskine took charge as commanderinchief of the colonys armed forces with the personal backing of winston churchill..the capture of waruhiu itote nom de guerre general china on  january  and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the mau mau command structure for the british. operation anvil opened on  april  after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the war council. the operation effectively placed nairobi under military siege. nairobis occupants were screened and suspected mau mau supporters moved to detention camps. more than  kikuyu were held in detention camps without trial often subject to brutal treatment. the home guard formed the core of the governments strategy as it was composed of loyalist africans not foreign forces such as the british army and kings african rifles..the capture of dedan kimathi on  october  in nyeri signified the ultimate defeat of the mau mau and essentially ended the military offensive. during this period substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. the most important of these was the swynnerton plan which was used to both reward loyalists and punish mau mau. this left roughly rd of kikuyu bereft of any tenancy land arrangement and thus propertyless at the time of independence..before kenya got its independence somali ethnic people in presentday kenya in the areas of northern frontier districts petitioned her majestys government not to be included in kenya. the colonial government decided to hold kenyas first referendum in  to check the willingness of somalis in kenya to join somalia..the result of the referendum showed that  of somalis in kenya wanted to join somalia yet the british colonial administration rejected the result and the somalis remained in kenya..the first direct elections for native kenyans to the legislative council took place in ..despite british hopes of handing power to moderate local rivals it was the kenya african national union kanu of jomo kenyatta that formed a government. the colony of kenya and the protectorate of kenya each came to an end on  december  with independence conferred on all of kenya. the u.k. ceded sovereignty over the colony of kenya. the sultan of zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the colony he would cease to have sovereignty over the protectorate of kenya so that all of kenya would become one sovereign state. in this way kenya became an independent country under the kenya independence act  of the united kingdom. on  december  kenya became a republic under the name republic of kenya..concurrently the kenyan army fought the shifta war against ethnic somali rebels inhabiting the northern frontier district who wanted to join their kin in the somali republic to the north. a ceasefire was eventually reached

effect..on  december  the republic of kenya was proclaimed and jomo kenyatta became kenyas first president. under kenyatta corruption became widespread throughout the government civil service and business community. kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after . their acquisitions in the central rift valley and coast provinces aroused great anger among landless kenyans. his family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. the kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business with kenyatta personally owning the leonard beach hotel..kenyattas mixed legacy was highlighted at the year anniversary of kenyas independence. a december  article in the new york times praised kenyattas leadership and kenya for emerging as a model of pragmatism and conservatism. kenyas gdp had increased at an annual rate of . higher than the population growth rate of more than . but amnesty international responded to the article by stating the cost of the stability in terms of human rights abuses. the opposition party started by oginga odingakenya peoples union kpuwas banned in  after the kisumu massacre and kpu leaders were still in detention without trial in gross violation of the u.n. declaration of human rights. the kenya students union jehovah witnesses and all opposition parties were outlawed. kenyatta ruled until his death on  august ..after kenyatta died daniel arap moi became president. he retained the presidency running unopposed in elections held in   snap elections and  all of which were held under the singleparty constitution. the  elections were held a year early and were a direct result of a failed military coup on  august ..the  coup was masterminded by a lowranking air force serviceman senior private hezekiah ochuka and was staged mainly by enlisted men of the air force. it was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by chief of general staff mahamoud mohamed a veteran somali military official. they included the general service unit gsua paramilitary wing of the policeand later the

later ordered in ..the election held in  saw the advent of the mlolongo queuing system where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of casting a secret ballot. this was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform. several contentious clauses including the one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years..in  kenya transitioned to a multiparty political system after  years of singleparty rule. on  october  moi dissolved parliament five months before the end of his term. as a result preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president. the election was scheduled to take place on  december  but delays led to its postponement to  december. apart from kanu the ruling party other parties represented in the elections included ford kenya and ford asili. this election was marked by largescale intimidation of opponents and harassment of election officials. it resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to retain power. this election was a turning point for kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of mois leadership and the rule of kanu. moi retained the presidency and george saitoti became vice president. although it held on to power kanu won  seats and lost  seats to the six opposition parties..the  elections marked the beginning of multiparty politics after more than  years of kanu rule. following skirmishes in the aftermath of the elections  people were killed and another  displaced from their homes. in the next five years many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections. in  jaramogi oginga odinga died and several coalitions joined his ford kenya party to form a new party united national democratic alliance. this party was plagued with disagreements. in  richard leakey formed the safina party but it was denied registration until november ..in  kanu revised the constitution to allow moi to remain president for another term. subsequently moi stood for reelection and won a th term in . his win was strongly criticised by his major opponents kibaki and odinga as fraudulent. following this win moi was constitutionally barred from another presidential term. beginning in  he attempted to influence the countrys succession politics to have uhuru kenyatta elected in the  elections..mois plan to be replaced by uhuru kenyatta failed and mwai kibaki running for the opposition coalition national rainbow coalition narc was elected president. david anderson  reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers and seemed to mark a turning point in kenyas democratic evolution..in  kenyans rejected a plan to replace the  independence constitution with a new one. as a result the elections of  took place following the procedure set by the old constitution. kibaki was reelected in highly contested elections marred by political and ethnic violence. the main opposition leader raila odinga claimed the election was rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president. in the ensuing violence  people were killed and another  internally displaced making it the worst postelection violence in kenya. to stop the death and displacement of

reportedly over by early  because of coordinated relief efforts. aid agencies subsequently shifted their emphasis to recovery initiatives including digging irrigation canals and distributing plant seeds..in august  kenyans held a referendum and passed a new constitution which limited presidential powers and devolved the central government. following the passage of the new constitution kenya became a presidential representative democratic republic whereby the president of kenya is both head of state and head of government and of a multiparty system. the new constitution also states that executive powers are exercised by the executive branch of government headed by the president who chairs a cabinet composed of people chosen from outside parliament. legislative power is vested exclusively in parliament. the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature..in  kenya held its first general elections under the  constitution. uhuru kenyatta won though the result was unsuccessfully challenged at the supreme court by opposition leader raila odinga. kenyatta was reelected in  in another disputed election. odinga accused the independent electoral and boundaries commission of mismanaging the election and kenyatta and his party of rigging. the supreme court overturned the results in a landmark ruling that established its position as an independent check on the president. in the repeated election kenyatta won after odinga refused to participate citing irregularities..in march  a historic handshake between kenyatta and odinga signaled a period of reconciliation followed by economic growth and increased stability. between  and  the two combined efforts to promote major changes to the kenyan constitution labelled the building bridges initiative bbi. they said their efforts were to improve inclusion and overcome the countrys election system that often resulted in postelection violence. the bbi proposal called for broad expansion of the legislative and executive branches including the creation of a prime minister with two deputies and an official leader of the opposition reverting to selecting cabinet ministers from among the elected members of parliament establishing up to  new constituencies and adding up to  unelected members of parliament under an affirmative action plan..critics saw this as an attempt to reward political dynasties and blunt deputy president willian rutos efforts to seek the presidency and bloat the government at a high cost to the debtladed country. ultimately in may  the kenyan high court ruled the bbi unconstitutional because it was an effort of the government rather than a popular initiative. the court sharply criticized kenyatta laying out grounds for his being sued or even impeached. the ruling was seen as a major defeat for both kenyatta and odinga but a boon to odingas future presidentialelection rival ruto. in august  kenyas court of appeal upheld the high courts judgement in an appeal from the bbi secretariat ..ruto narrowly won the  presidential election defeating odinga to become kenyas fifth president. in  ruto and the kenya kwanza coalition faced popular protests over

crops research institute for the semiarid tropics icrisat has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties instead of maize in particularly dry areas. pigeon peas are very droughtresistant so can be grown in areas with less than  millimetres in annual rainfall. successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agrodealer networks for distribution and marketing. this work which included linking producers to wholesalers helped to increase local producer prices by  in nairobi and mombasa. the

from nairobi to mombasa was suspended due to a dispute over compensation for land acquisition..in  the kenyan government unveiled vision  an economic development programme it hopes will put the country in the same league as the asian economic tigers by . in  it launched a national climate change action plan having acknowledged that omitting climate as a key development issue in vision  was an oversight failure. the page action plan developed with support from the climate  development knowledge network sets out the government of kenyas vision for a lowcarbon climate resilient development pathway. at the launch in march  the secretary of the ministry of planning national development and vision  emphasized that climate would be a central issue in the renewed mediumterm plan that would be launched in the coming months. this would create a direct and robust delivery framework for the action plan and ensure climate change is treated as an economywide issue. furthermore kenya submitted an updated more ambitious ndc on  december  with a commitment to abate greenhouse gases by  percent by  relative to the businessasusual scenario and in line with its sustainable development agenda and national circumstances..there exists an informal economy that is never counted as part of the official gdp figures..kenya has proven oil deposits in turkana county. president mwai kibaki announced on  march  that tullow oil an angloirish oil exploration firm had struck oil but its commercial viability and subsequent production would take about three years to confirm..early in  chinese president hu jintao signed an oil exploration contract with kenya part of a series of deals designed to keep africas natural resources flowing to chinas rapidly expanding economy..the deal allowed for chinas statecontrolled offshore oil and gas company cnooc to prospect for oil in kenya which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of sudan and the disputed area of north eastern province on the border with somalia and in coastal waters. there are formal estimates of the possible reserves of oil discovered..in  kenya banned singleuse plastic bags. according to the national environmental authority  of the public has adhered to this ban. subsequently in  the prohibition of singleuse plastics was extended to protected areas including parks and forests..a law passed in july  mandates companies to actively reduce the pollution and environmental impact caused by the products they introduce into the kenyan market either individually or through collective schemes. unlike previous practices businesses are now obligated to participate in waste collection and recycling initiatives such the petco initiative established by the government in ..kenya has a labour force of around  million and a total labour force participation rate of  the unemployment rate in  was estimated at ..according to the world banks  human capital index hci which measured human

purposes. additionally there are.out of approximately  million kenyans about  million are unable to receive financial service through formal loan application services and an additional  million have no access to financial service institutions at all. further one million kenyans are reliant on informal groups for receiving financial aid..to mitigate this problem the mobile banking service mpesa was launched in  by vodafone and safaricom in collaboration from the financial deepening challenge fund competition established by the uk governments department for international development. mpesa allows users to deposit withdraw transfer money pay for goods and services lipa na mpesa access credit and savings all with a mobile device has provided access to digital transactions to millions of kenyans in poverty situation..the census carried out by the kenya national bureau of statistics in  reported kenyas population as . the country has a young population with  of residents under  because of rapid population growth from . million to  million inhabitants over the last century..nairobi is home to kibera one of the worlds largest slums. the shantytown is believed to house between  and one million people. the unhcr base in dadaab in the north houses around ..kenya has a diverse population that includes many of africas major ethnoracial and linguistic groups. although there is no official list of kenyan ethnic groups the number of ethnic categories and subcategories recorded in the countrys census has changed significantly over time expanding from  in  to more than  in . most residents are bantus  or nilotes . cushitic groups also form a small ethnic minority as do arabs indians and europeans..according to the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs in  the largest native ethnic groups were the kikuyu  luhya  kalenjin  luo  kamba  somali  kisii  mijikenda  meru  maasai  and turkana . the north eastern province of kenya formerly known as nfd is predominantly inhabited by the indigenous ethnic somalis. foreignrooted populations include arabs asians and europeans..kenyas ethnic groups typically speak their mother tongues within their own communities. the two official languages english and swahili are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. english is widely spoken in commerce schooling and government. periurban and rural dwellers are less multilingual with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages..british english is primarily used in kenya. additionally a distinct local dialect kenyan english is used by some communities and individuals in the country and contains features unique to it that were derived from local bantu languages such as kiswahili and kikuyu. it has been developing since colonisation and also contains certain elements of american english. sheng is a kiswahilibased cant spoken in some urban areas. primarily a mixture of swahili and english it is an example of linguistic codeswitching.. languages are spoken in kenya. most belong to two broad language families nigercongo bantu branch and nilosaharan nilotic branch spoken by the countrys bantu and nilotic populations respectively. the cushitic and arab ethnic minorities speak languages belonging to the separate afroasiatic family with the indian and european residents speaking languages from the indoeuropean family..most kenyans are christian . with . protestant . roman catholic and . evangelical. roman catholicism is the largest single christian denomination in kenya with about  million members. the presbyterian church of east africa has  million followers in kenya and surrounding countries. there are smaller conservative reformed churches the africa evangelical presbyterian church the independent presbyterian church in kenya and the reformed church of east africa. orthodox christianity has  adherents. kenya has by far the highest number of quakers of any country in the world with around . the only jewish synagogue in the country is in nairobi..islam is the second largest religion comprising  of the population.  of kenyan muslims live in the coastal region comprising  of the total population there while the upper part of kenyas eastern region is home to  of the countrys muslims where they are the majority religious group. indigenous beliefs are practised by . of the population although many selfidentifying christians and muslims maintain some traditional beliefs and customs. nonreligious kenyans are . of the population..some hindus also live in kenya. the numbers are estimated to be around  or . of the population..health care is one of the lowpriority sectors in kenya and was allocated . of the national budget in  or just . of gdp compared to highpriority sectors such as education which was allocated more than . this is below the . average in subsaharan africa and . spent globally..according to the national and county health budget analysis fy  the breakdown of county health expenditure was  on policy planning and administrative support services  on curative and rehabilitative health services  on preventive and promotive health services and  on other programmes..health care is largely funded by private individuals and their families or employers through direct payments to health care providers to the national health insurance fund or to medical insurance companies. additional funding comes from local international and some government social safety net schemes. public hospitals are feeforservice establishments that generate large amounts of county and national government revenues making them highly political and corrupt enterprises..private health facilities are diverse highly dynamic and difficult to classify unlike public health facilities which are easily grouped in classes that consist of communitybased level i services run by community health workers dispensaries level ii facilities run by nurses health centres level iii facilities run by clinical officers subcounty hospitals level iv facilities which may be run by a clinical officer or a medical officer county hospitals level v facilities which may be run by a medical officer or a medical practitioner and national referral hospitals level vi facilities which are run by fully qualified medical practitioners..nurses are by far the largest group of frontline health care providers in all sectors followed by clinical officers medical officers and medical practitioners. these are absorbed and deployed into government service in accordance with the scheme of service for nursing personnel  the revised scheme of service for clinical personnel  and the revised scheme of service for medical officers and dental officers ..traditional healers herbalists witch doctors and faith healers are readily available trusted and widely consulted as practitioners of first or last choice by both rural and urban dwellers..despite major achievements in the health sector kenya still faces many challenges. the estimated life expectancy dropped in  to approximately  years  five years below the  level. the infant mortality rate was high at approximately  deaths per  children in . the who estimated in  that only  of births were attended by a skilled health professional..diseases of poverty directly correlate with a countrys economic performance and wealth distribution in  . of kenyans lived below the poverty line. preventable diseases like malaria hivaids pneumonia diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden major childkillers and responsible for much morbidity weak policies corruption inadequate health workers weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame. according to  estimates hivaids prevalence is about . of the adult population. however the  unaids report suggests that the hiv epidemic may be improving in kenya as hiv prevalence is declining among young people ages  and pregnant women. kenya had an estimated  million cases of malaria in . tuberculosis is a major public health problem. the per capita incidence of tb in kenya more than quadrupled between  and ..the  global hunger index gave kenya a . score indicating that the severity of hunger is serious..the total fertility rate in kenya was estimated to be . children per woman in . according to a  survey by the kenyan government the total fertility rate was . and the contraception usage rate among married women was . maternal mortality is high partly because of female genital mutilation with about  of women having undergone it.this practice is however on the decline as the country becomes more modernised and in  it was banned in kenya.women were economically empowered before colonialisation.by colonial land alienation women lost access and control of land. they became more economically dependent on men. a colonial order of gender emerged where males dominated females.median age at first marriage increases with increasing education.rape defilement and battering are not always seen as serious crimes.reports of sexual assault are not always taken seriously..article  of the kenyan constitution of  defines youth as those between the ages of  and . according to the  population and census results  percent of the . million population is under the age of  making kenya a country of the youth. youth unemployment and underemployment in kenya has become a problem. according to the kenya national bureau of statistics knbs approximately . million people lost their jobs as a result of the covid pandemic which eliminated some informal jobs and caused the economy to slow. the kenyan government has made progress in addressing the high youth unemployment by implementing various affirmative action programs and projects which include the national youth service the national youth enterprise development fund the women enterprise fund kazi mtaani ajira digital kikao mtaani uwezo fund future bora and studio mashinani that empower youth offer job opportunities and to raise ones standard of living..children attend nursery school or kindergarten in the private sector until they are five years old. this lasts one to three years kg kg and kg and is financed privately because there has been no government policy on preschooling until recently..basic formal education starts at age six and lasts  years consisting of eight years in primary school and four in high school or secondary. primary school is free in public schools and those attending can join a vocational youthvillage polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring carpentry motor vehicle repair bricklaying and masonry for about two years..those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to university and study for four years. graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialised higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training or join the universityusually in the second or third year of their respective course. the higher diploma is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelors degree and direct or accelerated admission to postgraduate studies is possible in some universities..public universities in kenya are highly commercialised institutions and only a small fraction of qualified high school graduates are admitted on limited governmentsponsorship into programs of their choice. most are admitted into the social sciences which are cheap to run or as selfsponsored students paying the full cost of their studies. most qualified students who miss out opt for middlelevel diploma programs in public or private universities colleges and polytechnics..in  . percent of the kenyan adult population was illiterate which was the highest rate of literacy in east africa. there are very wide regional disparities for example nairobi had the highest level of literacy at . per cent compared to north eastern province the lowest at . per cent. preschool which targets children from age three to five is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to standard one first grade. at the end of primary education pupils sit the kenya certificate of primary education kcpe which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training. the result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school..primary school is for students aged  years. for those who proceed to the secondary level there is a national examination at the end of form four the kenya certificate of secondary education kcse which determines those proceeding to the universities other professional training or employment. students sit examinations in eight subjects of their choosing. however english kiswahili and mathematics are compulsory subjects..the kenya universities and colleges central placement service kuccps formerly the joint admissions board jab is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities. other than the public schools there are many private schools mainly in urban areas. similarly there are a number of international schools catering to various overseas educational systems..kenya was ranked th in the global innovation index in ..the culture of kenya comprises multiple traditions. kenya has no single prominent culture. it instead consists of the various cultures of the countrys different communities..notable populations include the swahili on the coast several other bantu communities in the central and western regions and nilotic communities in the northwest. the maasai culture is well known to tourism despite constituting a relatively small part of kenyas population. they are renowned for their elaborate upperbody adornment and jewellery..kenya has an extensive music television and theatre scene..ngg wa thiongo is one of kenyas bestknown writers. his novel weep not child depicts life in kenya during the british occupation. the story details the effects of the mau mau on the lives of kenyans. its combination of themescolonialism education and lovehelped make it one of the bestknown african novels..m.g. vassanjis  novel the inbetween world of vikram lall won the giller prize in . it is the fictional memoir of a kenyan of indian heritage and his family as they adjust to the changing political climates in colonial and postcolonial kenya..since  the literary journal kwani has been publishing kenyan contemporary literature. kenya has also nurtured emerging versatile authors such as paul kipchumba kipwendui kibiwott who demonstrate a panafrican outlook..kenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms in addition to multiple types of folk music based on the variety of over  regional languages..drums are the most dominant instrument in popular kenyan music. drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythms and imported ones especially the congolese cavacha rhythm. popular kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts and more recently showy guitar solos as well. there are also a number of local hiphop artists including jua cali afropop bands such as sauti sol and musicians who play local genres like benga such as akothee..lyrics are most often in kiswahili or english. there is also some emerging aspect of lingala borrowed from congolese musicians. lyrics are also written in local languages. urban radio generally only plays english music though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations..zilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the s s and s by musicians such as daudi kabaka fadhili william and sukuma bin ongaro and is particularly enjoyed by older peoplehaving been popularised by the kenya broadcasting corporations kiswahili service formerly called voice of kenya or vok..the isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the luhya subtribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child marriage or funeral. other traditional dances include the ohangla among the luo nzele among the mijikenda mugithi among the kikuyu and taarab among the swahili..kenya has a growing christian gospel music scene. prominent local gospel musicians include the kenyan boys choir..benga music has been popular since the late s especially in the area around lake victoria. the word benga is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. bass guitar and percussion are the usual instruments..kenya is active in several sports among them cricket rallying football rugby field hockey and boxing. the country is known chiefly for its dominance in middledistance and longdistance athletics having consistently produced olympic and commonwealth games champions in various distance events especially in m m m steeplechase m m and the marathon. kenyan athletes particularly kalenjin continue to dominate the world of distance running although competition from morocco and ethiopia has reduced this supremacy. some of kenyas bestknown athletes include the fourtime womens boston marathon winner and twotime world champion catherine ndereba m world record holder david rudisha former marathon world recordholder paul tergat and m olympic gold medalist john ngugi. kenyas most decorated athlete is threetime olympic gold medalist and eleventime world marathon major champion eliud kipchoge..kenya won several medals during the beijing olympics six gold four silver and four bronze making it africas most successful nation in the  olympics. new athletes gained attention such as pamela jelimo the womens m gold medalist who went on to win the iaaf golden league jackpot and samuel wanjiru who won the mens marathon. retired olympic and commonwealth games champion kipchoge keino helped usher in kenyas ongoing distance dynasty in the s and was followed by commonwealth champion henry ronos spectacular string of world record performances. lately there has been controversy in kenyan athletics circles with the defection of a number of kenyan athletes to represent other countries chiefly bahrain and qatar. the kenyan ministry of sports has tried to stop the defections but they have continued anyway with bernard lagat being the latest choosing to represent the united states. most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors. decisions by the kenyan government to tax athletes earnings may also be a motivating factor. some elite kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their countrys strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries..kenya has been a dominant force in womens volleyball within africa with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade. the womens team has competed at the olympics and world championships though without any notable success. cricket is another popular sport also ranking as the most successful team sport. kenya has competed in the cricket world cup since . they upset some of the worlds best teams and reached the semifinals of the  tournament. they won the inaugural world cricket league division  hosted in nairobi and participated in the world t. they also participated in the icc cricket world cup . their current captain is rakep patel..rugby is increasing in popularity especially with the annual safari sevens tournament. the kenya sevens team ranked th in the irb sevens world series for the  season. in  the team beat fiji at the singapore sevens finals making kenya the second african nation after south africa to win a world series championship. kenya was once also a regional powerhouse in football. however its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct kenya football federation leading to a suspension by fifa which was lifted in march ..in the motor rallying arena kenya is home to the worldfamous safari rally commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world. first held in  it was a part of the world rally championship for many years until its exclusion after the  event owing to financial difficulties. some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally such as bjrn waldegrd hannu mikkola tommi mkinen shekhar mehta carlos sainz and colin mcrae. the safari rally returned to the world championship in  after the  events ran as part of the african rally championship..nairobi has hosted several major continental sports events including the fiba africa championship  where kenyas national basketball team finished in the top four its best performance to date..kenya also has its own ice hockey team the kenya ice lions. the teams home ground is the solar ice rink at the panari sky centre in nairobi which is the first and largest ice rink in all of africa..kenya mens national field hockey team was considered one of the good teams in the world during s and s..kenya took th position in  summer olympics hockey tournament and th in  mens fih hockey world cup..kenyans generally have three meals in a daybreakfast kiamsha kinywa lunch chakula cha mchana and supper chakula cha jioni or simply chajio. in between they have the oclock tea chai ya saa nne and  p.m. tea chai ya saa kumi. breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread chapati mahamri boiled sweet potatoes or yams. githeri is a common lunchtime dish in many households while ugali with vegetables sour milk mursik meat fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper. regional variations and dishes also exist..in western kenya among the luo fish is a common dish among the kalenjin who dominate much of the rift valley region mursiksour milkis a common drink..in cities such as nairobi there are fastfood restaurants including steers kfc and subway. there are also many fishandchips shops..cheese is becoming more popular in kenya with consumption increasing particularly among the middle class..n e  n e   .natural language processing nlp is a subfield of computer science and especially artificial intelligence. it is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics..major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification natural language understanding and natural language generation..natural language processing has its roots in the s. already in  alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence. the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language..the premise of symbolic nlp is wellsummarized by john searles chinese room experiment given a collection of rules e.g. a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other nlp tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts..up until the s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules.  starting in the late s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.  this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics e.g. transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing..symbolic approach i.e. the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by ai in general and by nlp in particular such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming..machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach .rulebased systems are commonly used.in the late s and mids the statistical approach ended a period of ai winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches..the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches.only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach..a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering. since  the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words.  .intermediate tasks e.g. partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore. .neural machine translation based on thennewly invented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation..the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing. some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks..though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience. a coarse division is given below..based on longstanding trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp. as of  three trends among the topics of the longstanding series of conll shared tasks can be observed.most higherlevel nlp applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language. more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of nlp see trends among conll shared tasks above..cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses. cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics. especially during the age of symbolic nlp the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies..as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing nlp algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics with two defining aspects.ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of nlp but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the s. nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks e.g. of cognitive grammar functional grammar construction grammar computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience e.g. actr however with limited uptake in mainstream nlp as measured by presence on major conferences of the acl. more recently ideas of cognitive nlp have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability e.g. under the notion of cognitive ai. likewise ideas of cognitive nlp are inherent to neural models multimodal nlp although rarely made explicit and developments in artificial intelligence specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle by british neuroscientist and theoretician at university college london karl j. friston...artificial intelligence ai is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence such as learning reasoning problemsolving perception and decisionmaking. it is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals..highprofile applications of ai include advanced web search engines e.g. google search recommendation systems used by youtube amazon and netflix virtual assistants e.g. google assistant siri and alexa autonomous vehicles e.g. waymo generative and creative tools e.g. chatgpt and ai art and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games e.g. chess and go. however many ai applications are not perceived as ai a lot of cutting edge ai has filtered into general applications often without being called ai because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore..various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for robotics. to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics. ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields. some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general intelligence agiai that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human..artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in  and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters. funding and interest vastly increased after  when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques. this growth accelerated further after  with the transformer architecture. in the s the period of rapid progress marked by advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom. generative ai and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology..the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems. these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research..early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions. by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics..many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow. even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model. they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments. accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem..knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts. formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas..a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge. knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects properties categories and relations between objects situations events states and time causes and effects knowledge about knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge..among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally. there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications..an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen. in automated planning the agent has a specific goal. in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid. the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it. for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility..in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be. in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic. it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked..in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved. these can be learned e.g. with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences. information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions. the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be..a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. a policy associates a decision with each possible state. the policy could be calculated e.g. by iteration be heuristic or it can be learned..game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in ai programs that make decisions that involve other agents..machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. it has been a part of ai from the beginning..there are several kinds of machine learning. unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance. supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers and comes in two main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input..in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good. transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem. deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning..computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization..natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english. specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering..early work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem. margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure..modern deep learning techniques for nlp include word embedding representing words typically as vectors encoding their meaning transformers a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism and others. in  generative pretrained transformer or gpt language models began to generate coherent text and by  these models were able to get humanlevel scores on the bar exam sat test gre test and many other realworld applications..machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors such as cameras microphones wireless signals active lidar sonar radar and tactile sensors to deduce aspects of the world. computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input..the field includes speech recognition image classification facial recognition object recognitionobject tracking and robotic perception..affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood. for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction..however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents. moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject..a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence..ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above..ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions. there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search..state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state. for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis..simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers. the result is a search that is too slow or never completes. heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal..adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go. it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position..local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally..gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm..another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation..distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails..formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys..deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises. proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules..given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem. in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved..inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable. however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete. moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages..fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between  and . it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true..nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning. other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains..many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics. precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan using decision theory decision analysis and information value theory. these tools include models such as markov decision processes dynamic decision networks game theory and mechanism design..bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning using the bayesian inference algorithm learning using the expectationmaximization algorithm planning using decision networks and perception using dynamic bayesian networks..probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering prediction smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time e.g. hidden markov models or kalman filters..the simplest ai applications can be divided into two types classifiers e.g. if shiny then diamond on one hand and controllers e.g. if diamond then pick up on the other hand. classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. they can be finetuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. each pattern also called an observation is labeled with a certain predefined class. all the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. when a new observation is received that observation is classified based on previous experience..there are many kinds of classifiers in use. the decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm. knearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical ai until the mids and kernel methods such as the support vector machine svm displaced knearest neighbor in the s.the naive bayes classifier is reportedly the most widely used learner at google due in part to its scalability.neural networks are also used as classifiers..an artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. it is trained to recognise patterns once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. there is an input at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold the data is transmitted to the next layer. a network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least  hidden layers..learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. the most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm. neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. in theory a neural network can learn any function..in feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction. recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input which allows shortterm memories of previous input events. long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks. perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons deep learning uses multiple layers. convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are close to each otherthis is especially important in image processing where a local set of neurons must identify an edge before the network can identify an object..deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the networks inputs and outputs. the multiple layers can progressively extract higherlevel features from the raw input. for example in image processing lower layers may identify edges while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits letters or faces..deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence including computer vision speech recognition natural language processing image classification and others. the reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of . the sudden success of deep learning in  did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people as far back as the s but because of two factors the incredible increase in computer power including the hundredfold increase in speed by switching to gpus and the availability of vast amounts of training data especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing such as imagenet..generative pretrained transformers gpt are large language models llms that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. textbased gpt models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the internet. the pretraining consists of predicting the next token a token being usually a word subword or punctuation. throughout this pretraining gpt models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate humanlike text by repeatedly predicting the next token. typically a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful useful and harmless usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback rlhf. current gpt models are prone to generating falsehoods called hallucinations. these can be reduced with rlhf and quality data but the problem has been getting worse for reasoning systems. such systems are used in chatbots which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text..current models and services include gemini formerly bard chatgpt grok claude copilot and llama. multimodal gpt models can process different types of data modalities such as images videos sound and text..in the late s graphics processing units gpus that were increasingly designed with aispecific enhancements and used with specialized tensorflow software had replaced previously used central processing unit cpus as the dominant means for largescale commercial and academic machine learning models training. specialized programming languages such as prolog were used in early ai research but generalpurpose programming languages like python have become predominant..the transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every  monthsa trend known as moores law named after the intel cofounder gordon moore who first identified it. improvements in gpus have been even faster a trend sometimes called huangs law named after nvidia cofounder and ceo jensen huang..ai and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the s including search engines such as google search targeting online advertisements recommendation systems offered by netflix youtube or amazon driving internet traffic targeted advertising adsense facebook virtual assistants such as siri or alexa autonomous vehicles including drones adas and selfdriving cars automatic language translation microsoft translator google translate facial recognition apples faceid or microsofts deepface and googles facenet and image labeling used by facebook apples photos and tiktok. the deployment of ai may be overseen by a chief automation officer cao..the application of ai in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life. through the lens of the hippocratic oath medical professionals are ethically compelled to use ai if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients..for medical research ai is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. this is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication. it has been suggested that ai can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research. new ai tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. for example alphafold   demonstrated the ability to approximate in hours rather than months the d structure of a protein. in  it was reported that aiguided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drugresistant bacteria. in  researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for parkinsons disease drug treatments. their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping or aggregation of alphasynuclein the protein that characterises parkinsons disease. they were able to speed up the initial screening process tenfold and reduce the cost by a thousandfold..game playing programs have been used since the s to demonstrate and test ais most advanced techniques. deep blue became the first computer chessplaying system to beat a reigning world chess champion garry kasparov on  may . in  in a jeopardy quiz show exhibition match ibms question answering system watson defeated the two greatest jeopardy champions brad rutter and ken jennings by a significant margin. in march  alphago won  out of  games of go in a match with go champion lee sedol becoming the first computer goplaying system to beat a professional go player without handicaps. then in  it defeated ke jie who was the best go player in the world. other programs handle imperfectinformation games such as the pokerplaying program pluribus. deepmind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models such as with muzero which could be trained to play chess go or atari games. in  deepminds alphastar achieved grandmaster level in starcraft ii a particularly challenging realtime strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map. in  an ai agent competed in a playstation gran turismo competition winning against four of the worlds best gran turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning. in  google deepmind introduced sima a type of ai capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen openworld video games by observing screen output as well as executing short specific tasks in response to natural language instructions..large language models such as gpt gemini claude llama or mistral are increasingly used in mathematics. these probabilistic models are versatile but can also produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. they sometimes need a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised finetuning or trained classifiers with humanannotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections. a february  study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data. one technique to improve their performance involves training the models to produce correct reasoning steps rather than just the correct result. the alibaba group developed a version of its qwen models called qwenmath that achieved stateoftheart performance on several mathematical benchmarks including  accuracy on the math dataset of competition mathematics problems. in january  microsoft proposed the technique rstarmath that leverages monte carlo tree search and stepbystep reasoning enabling a relatively small language model like qwenb to solve  of the aime  and  of the math benchmark problems..alternatively dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as alphatensor alphageometry and alphaproof all from google deepmind llemma from eleutherai or julius..when natural language is used to describe mathematical problems converters can transform such prompts into a formal language such as lean to define mathematical tasks..some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests others to serve as educational tools in mathematics..topological deep learning integrates various topological approaches..finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied ai tools are being deployed from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance where automated robot advisers have been in use for some years..according to nicolas firzli director of the world pensions  investments forum it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative aiinformed financial products and services. he argues that the deployment of ai tools will simply further automatise things destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking financial planning and pension advice in the process but im not sure it will unleash a new wave of  pension innovation..various countries are deploying ai military applications. the main applications enhance command and control communications sensors integration and interoperability. research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis logistics cyber operations information operations and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles. ai technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors threat detection and identification marking of enemy positions target acquisition coordination and deconfliction of distributed joint fires between networked combat vehicles both human operated and autonomous..ai has been used in military operations in iraq syria israel and ukraine..generative artificial intelligence generative ai genai or gai is a subfield of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to produce text images videos or other forms of data. these models learn the underlying patterns and structures of their training data and use them to produce new data based on the input which often comes in the form of natural language prompts..generative ai tools have become more common since an ai boom in the s. this boom was made possible by improvements in transformerbased deep neural networks particularly large language models llms. major tools include chatbots such as chatgpt copilot gemini grok and deepseek texttoimage artificial intelligence image generation systems such as stable diffusion midjourney and dalle and texttovideo ai generators such as sora. technology companies developing generative ai include openai anthropic meta ai microsoft google deepseek and baidu..artificial intelligent ai agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment make decisions and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. these agents can interact with users their environment or other agents. ai agents are used in various applications including virtual assistants chatbots autonomous vehicles gameplaying systems and industrial robotics. ai agents operate within the constraints of their programming available computational resources and hardware limitations. this means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. in realworld applications ai agents often face time constraints for decisionmaking and action execution. many ai agents incorporate learning algorithms enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. using machine learning ai agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks..applications of ai in this domain include aienabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction aiintegrated sex toys e.g. teledildonics aigenerated sexual education content and ai agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners e.g. replika.  ai is also used for the production of nonconsensual deepfake pornography raising significant ethical and legal concerns..ai technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online genderbased violence and online sexual grooming of minors..there are also thousands of successful ai applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. in a  survey one in five companies reported having incorporated ai in some offerings or processes. a few examples are energy storage medical diagnosis military logistics applications that predict the result of judicial decisions foreign policy or supply chain management..ai applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. ai has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from gps videos or social media. further ai can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions..in agriculture ai has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation fertilization pesticide treatments or increasing yield. agronomists use ai to conduct research and development. ai has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes monitor soil moisture operate agricultural robots conduct predictive analytics classify livestock pig call emotions automate greenhouses detect diseases and pests and save water..artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications mainly for classification regression clustering forecasting generation discovery and the development of new scientific insights. for example it is used for discovering exoplanets forecasting solar activity and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. additionally it could be used for activities in space such as space exploration including the analysis of data from space missions realtime science decisions of spacecraft space debris avoidance and more autonomous operation..during the  indian elections us million was spent on authorized aigenerated content notably by creating deepfakes of allied including sometimes deceased politicians to better engage with voters and by translating speeches to various local languages..ai has potential benefits and potential risks. ai may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems demis hassabis of deepmind hopes to solve intelligence and then use that to solve everything else. however as the use of ai has become widespread several unintended consequences and risks have been identified. inproduction systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their ai training processes especially when the ai algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning..machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. the techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy surveillance and copyright..aipowered devices and services such as virtual assistants and iot products continuously collect personal information raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. the loss of privacy is further exacerbated by ais ability to process and combine vast amounts of data potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency..sensitive user data collected may include online activity records geolocation data video or audio. for example in order to build speech recognition algorithms amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them. opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy..ai developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data such as data aggregation deidentification and differential privacy. since  some privacy experts such as cynthia dwork have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. brian christian wrote that experts have pivoted from the question of what they know to the question of what theyre doing with it..generative ai is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works including in domains such as images or computer code the output is then used under the rationale of fair use. experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law relevant factors may include the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work and the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work. website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a robots.txt file. in  leading authors including john grisham and jonathan franzen sued ai companies for using their work to train generative ai. another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by ai to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors..the commercial ai scene is dominated by big tech companies such as alphabet inc. amazon apple inc. meta platforms and microsoft. some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace..in january  the international energy agency iea released electricity  analysis and forecast to  forecasting electric power use. this is the first iea report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. the report states that power demand for these uses might double by  with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole japanese nation..prodigious power consumption by ai is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use and might delay closings of obsolete carbonemitting coal energy facilities. there is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the us making large technology firms e.g. microsoft meta google amazon into voracious consumers of electric power. projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. a chatgpt search involves the use of  times the electrical energy as a google search. the large firms are in haste to find power sources  from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. the tech firms argue that  in the long view  ai will be eventually kinder to the environment but they need the energy now. ai makes the power grid more efficient and intelligent will assist in the growth of nuclear power and track overall carbon emissions according to technology firms..a  goldman sachs research paper ai data centers and the coming us power demand surge found us power demand is likely to experience growth not seen in a generation.... and forecasts that by  us data centers will consume  of us power as opposed to  in  presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means. data centers need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. the big tech companies counter that ai can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all..in  the wall street journal reported that big ai companies have begun negotiations with the us nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. in march  amazon purchased a pennsylvania nuclearpowered data center for  million us. nvidia ceo jenhsun huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers..in september  microsoft announced an agreement with constellation energy to reopen the three mile island nuclear power plant to provide microsoft with  of all electric power produced by the plant for  years. reopening the plant which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its unit  reactor in  will require constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the us nuclear regulatory commission. if approved this will be the first ever us recommissioning of a nuclear plant over  megawatts of power  enough for  homes  of energy will be produced. the cost for reopening and upgrading is estimated at . billion us and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the  us inflation reduction act. the us government and the state of michigan are investing almost  billion us to reopen the palisades nuclear reactor on lake michigan. closed since  the plant is planned to be reopened in october . the three mile island facility will be renamed the crane clean energy center after chris crane a nuclear proponent and former ceo of exelon who was responsible for exelon spinoff of constellation..after the last approval in september  taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of taoyuan with a capacity of more than  mw in  due to power supply shortages. taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by . on the other hand singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in  due to electric power but in  lifted this ban..although most nuclear plants in japan have been shut down after the  fukushima nuclear accident according to an october  bloomberg article in japanese cloud gaming services company ubitus in which nvidia has a stake is looking for land in japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative ai. ubitus ceo wesley kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient cheap and stable power for ai..on  november  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc rejected an application submitted by talen energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station susquehanna to amazons data center. according to the commission chairman willie l. phillips it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors..in  a report prepared by the international energy agency estimated the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy consumption of ai at  million tons. by  these emissions could rise to  million tonnes depending on what measures will be taken. this is below . of the energy sector emissions. the emissions reduction potential of ai was estimated at  of the energy sector emissions but rebound effects for example if people will pass from public transport to autonomous cars can reduce it..youtube facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. these ai programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement that is the only goal was to keep people watching. the ai learned that users tended to choose misinformation conspiracy theories and extreme partisan content and to keep them watching the ai recommended more of it. users also tended to watch more content on the same subject so the ai led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation. this convinced many users that the misinformation was true and ultimately undermined trust in institutions the media and the government. the ai program had correctly learned to maximize its goal but the result was harmful to society. after the u.s. election in  major technology companies took some steps to mitigate the problem..in  generative ai began to create images audio video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs recordings films or human writing. it is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda. one such potential malicious use is deepfakes for computational propaganda. ai pioneer geoffrey hinton expressed concern about ai enabling authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates on a large scale among other risks..ai researchers at microsoft openai universities and other organisations have suggested using personhood credentials as a way to overcome online deception enabled by ai models..machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data. the developers may not be aware that the bias exists. bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed. if a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people as it can in medicine finance recruitment housing or policing then the algorithm may cause discrimination. the field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases..on june   google photoss new image labeling feature mistakenly identified jacky alcine and a friend as gorillas because they were black. the system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people a problem called sample size disparity. google fixed this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a gorilla. eight years later in  google photos still could not identify a gorilla and neither could similar products from apple facebook microsoft and amazon..compas is a commercial program widely used by u.s. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. in  julia angwin at propublica discovered that compas exhibited racial bias despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly  the errors for each race were differentthe system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would reoffend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not reoffend. in  several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for compas to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of reoffense were different for whites and blacks in the data..a program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature such as race or gender. the feature will correlate with other features like address shopping history or first name and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on race or gender. moritz hardt said the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesnt work..criticism of compas highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make predictions that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. if they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. if an application then uses these predictions as recommendations some of these recommendations will likely be racist. thus machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. it is descriptive rather than prescriptive..bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male among ai engineers about  are black and  are women..there are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. these notions depend on ethical assumptions and are influenced by beliefs about society. one broad category is distributive fairness which focuses on the outcomes often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. representational fairness tries to ensure that ai systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. the most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context notably the type of ai application and the stakeholders. the subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many ai ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases but it may conflict with antidiscrimination laws..at its  conference on fairness accountability and transparency acm facct  the association for computing machinery in seoul south korea presented and published findings that recommend that until ai and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes they are unsafe and the use of selflearning neural networks trained on vast unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed..many ai systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions. particularly with deep neural networks in which there are a large amount of nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs. but some popular explainability techniques exist..it is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. there have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. for example a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as cancerous because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale. another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at low risk of dying from pneumonia. having asthma is actually a severe risk factor but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. the correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real but misleading..people who have been harmed by an algorithms decision have a right to an explanation. doctors for example are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. early drafts of the european unions general data protection regulation in  included an explicit statement that this right exists. industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real if the problem has no solution the tools should not be used..darpa established the xai explainable artificial intelligence program in  to try to solve these problems..several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. shap enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output. lime can locally approximate a models outputs with a simpler interpretable model. multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. these other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned. deconvolution deepdream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning. for generative pretrained transformers anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with humanunderstandable concepts..artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors such as authoritarian governments terrorists criminals or rogue states..a lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates selects and engages human targets without human supervision. widely available ai tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and if produced at scale they are potentially weapons of mass destruction. even when used in conventional warfare they currently cannot reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person. in   nations including china supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the united nations convention on certain conventional weapons however the united states and others disagreed. by  over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots..ai tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. machine learning operating this data can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. deepfakes and generative ai aid in producing misinformation. advanced ai can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. it lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware. all these technologies have been available since  or earlierai facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in china..there many other ways that ai is expected to help bad actors some of which can not be foreseen. for example machinelearning ai is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours..economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from ai and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment..in the past technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment but economists acknowledge that were in uncharted territory with ai. a survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and ai will cause a substantial increase in longterm unemployment but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed. risk estimates vary for example in the s michael osborne and carl benedikt frey estimated  of u.s. jobs are at high risk of potential automation while an oecd report classified only  of u.s. jobs as high risk. the methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation and for implying that technology rather than social policy creates unemployment as opposed to redundancies. in april  it was reported that  of the jobs for chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence..unlike previous waves of automation many middleclass jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence the economist stated in  that the worry that ai could do to whitecollar jobs what steam power did to bluecollar ones during the industrial revolution is worth taking seriously. jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks while job demand is likely to increase for carerelated professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy..from the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments for example those put forward by joseph weizenbaum about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them given the difference between computers and humans and between quantitative calculation and qualitative valuebased judgement..it has been argued ai will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. this could as physicist stephen hawking stated spell the end of the human race. this scenario has been common in science fiction when a computer or robot suddenly develops a humanlike selfawareness or sentience or consciousness and becomes a malevolent character. these scifi scenarios are misleading in several ways..first ai does not require humanlike sentience to be an existential risk. modern ai programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. philosopher nick bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful ai it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it he used the example of a paperclip factory manager. stuart russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged reasoning that you cant fetch the coffee if youre dead. in order to be safe for humanity a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanitys morality and values so that it is fundamentally on our side..second yuval noah harari argues that ai does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. the essential parts of civilization are not physical. things like ideologies law government money and the economy are built on language they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. the current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an ai could use language to convince people to believe anything even to take actions that are destructive..the opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent ai. personalities such as stephen hawking bill gates and elon musk as well as ai pioneers such as yoshua bengio stuart russell demis hassabis and sam altman have expressed concerns about existential risk from ai..in may  geoffrey hinton announced his resignation from google in order to be able to freely speak out about the risks of ai without considering how this impacts google. he notably mentioned risks of an ai takeover and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of ai..in  many leading ai experts endorsed the joint statement that mitigating the risk of extinction from ai should be a global priority alongside other societalscale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war..some other researchers were more optimistic. ai pioneer jrgen schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement emphasising that in  of all cases ai research is about making human lives longer and healthier and easier. while the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors they can also be used against the bad actors. andrew ng also argued that its a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on aiand that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests. yann lecun scoffs at his peers dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even eventually human extinction. in the early s experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine. however after  the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research..friendly ai are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. eliezer yudkowsky who coined the term argues that developing friendly ai should be a higher research priority it may require a large investment and it must be completed before ai becomes an existential risk..machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. the field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.the field of machine ethics is also called computational moralityand was founded at an aaai symposium in ..other approaches include wendell wallachs artificial moral agents and stuart j. russells three principles for developing provably beneficial machines..active organizations in the ai opensource community include hugging face google eleutherai and meta. various ai models such as llama  mistral or stable diffusion have been made openweight meaning that their architecture and trained parameters the weights are publicly available. openweight models can be freely finetuned which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own usecase. openweight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. since they can be finetuned any builtin security measure such as objecting to harmful requests can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. some researchers warn that future ai models may develop dangerous capabilities such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism and that once released on the internet they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. they recommend prerelease audits and costbenefit analyses..artificial intelligence projects can be guided by ethical considerations during the design development and implementation of an ai system. an ai framework such as the care and act framework developed by the alan turing institute and based on the sum values outlines four main ethical dimensions defined as follows.other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the asilomar conference the montreal declaration for responsible ai and the ieees ethics of autonomous systems initiative among others however these principles are not without criticism especially regards to the people chosen to contribute to these frameworks..promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of ai system design development and implementation and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists product managers data engineers domain experts and delivery managers..the uk ai safety institute released in  a testing toolset called inspect for ai safety evaluations available under a mit opensource licence which is freely available on github and can be improved with thirdparty packages. it can be used to evaluate ai models in a range of areas including core knowledge ability to reason and autonomous capabilities..the regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating ai it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms. the regulatory and policy landscape for ai is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally. according to ai index at stanford the annual number of airelated laws passed in the  survey countries jumped from one passed in  to  passed in  alone. between  and  more than  countries adopted dedicated strategies for ai. most eu member states had released national ai strategies as had canada china india japan mauritius the russian federation saudi arabia united arab emirates u.s. and vietnam. others were in the process of elaborating their own ai strategy including bangladesh malaysia and tunisia. the global partnership on artificial intelligence was launched in june  stating a need for ai to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology. henry kissinger eric schmidt and daniel huttenlocher published a joint statement in november  calling for a government commission to regulate ai. in  openai leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence which they believe may happen in less than  years. in  the united nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on ai governance the body comprises technology company executives governments officials and academics. in  the council of europe created the first international legally binding treaty on ai called the framework convention on artificial intelligence and human rights democracy and the rule of law. it was adopted by the european union the united states the united kingdom and other signatories..in a  ipsos survey attitudes towards ai varied greatly by country  of chinese citizens but only  of americans agreed that products and services using ai have more benefits than drawbacks. a  reutersipsos poll found that  of americans agree and  disagree that ai poses risks to humanity. in a  fox news poll  of americans thought it very important and an additional  thought it somewhat important for the federal government to regulate ai versus  responding not very important and  responding not at all important..in november  the first global ai safety summit was held in bletchley park in the uk to discuss the near and far term risks of ai and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.  countries including the united states china and the european union issued a declaration at the start of the summit calling for international cooperation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. in may  at the ai seoul summit  global ai tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of ai..the study of mechanical or formal reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. the study of logic led directly to alan turings theory of computation which suggested that a machine by shuffling symbols as simple as  and  could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning. this along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics information theory and neurobiology led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain. they developed several areas of research that would become part of ai such as mccullouch and pitts design for artificial neurons in  and turings influential  paper computing machinery and intelligence which introduced the turing test and showed that machine intelligence was plausible..the field of ai research was founded at a workshop at dartmouth college in . the attendees became the leaders of ai research in the s. they and their students produced programs that the press described as astonishing computers were learning checkers strategies solving word problems in algebra proving logical theorems and speaking english. artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of british and u.s. universities in the latter s and early s..researchers in the s and the s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field. in  herbert simon predicted machines will be capable within twenty years of doing any work a man can do. in  marvin minsky agreed writing that within a generation... the problem of creating artificial intelligence will substantially be solved. they had however underestimated the difficulty of the problem. in  both the u.s. and british governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of sir james lighthill and ongoing pressure from the u.s. congress to fund more productive projects. minskys and paperts book perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving realworld tasks thus discrediting the approach altogether. the ai winter a period when obtaining funding for ai projects was difficult followed..in the early s ai research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems a form of ai program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. by  the market for ai had reached over a billion dollars. at the same time japans fifth generation computer project inspired the u.s. and british governments to restore funding for academic research. however beginning with the collapse of the lisp machine market in  ai once again fell into disrepute and a second longerlasting winter began..up to this point most of ais funding had gone to projects that used highlevel symbols to represent mental objects like plans goals beliefs and known facts. in the s some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition especially perception robotics learning and pattern recognition and began to look into subsymbolic approaches. rodney brooks rejected representation in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive. judea pearl lofti zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic. but the most important development was the revival of connectionism including neural network research by geoffrey hinton and others. in  yann lecun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits the first of many successful applications of neural networks..ai gradually restored its reputation in the late s and early st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. this narrow and formal focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields such as statistics economics and mathematics. by  solutions developed by ai researchers were being widely used although in the s they were rarely described as artificial intelligence a tendency known as the ai effect.however several academic researchers became concerned that ai was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile fully intelligent machines. beginning around  they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence or agi which had several wellfunded institutions by the s..deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in  and was adopted throughout the field.for many specific tasks other methods were abandoned.deep learnings success was based on both hardware improvements faster computers graphics processing units cloud computing and access to large amounts of data including curated datasets such as imagenet. deep learnings success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in ai. the amount of machine learning research measured by total publications increased by  in the years ..in  issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences publications vastly increased funding became available and many researchers refocussed their careers on these issues. the alignment problem became a serious field of academic study..in the late s and early s agi companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. in  alphago developed by deepmind beat the world champion go player. the program taught only the games rules and developed a strategy by itself. gpt is a large language model that was released in  by openai and is capable of generating highquality humanlike text. chatgpt launched on november   became the fastestgrowing consumer software application in history gaining over  million users in two months. it marked what is widely regarded as ais breakout year bringing it into the public consciousness. these programs and others inspired an aggressive ai boom where large companies began investing billions of dollars in ai research. according to ai impacts about  billion annually was invested in ai around  in the u.s. alone and about  of the new u.s. computer science phd graduates have specialized in ai. about  airelated u.s. job openings existed in . according to pitchbook research  of newly funded startups in  claimed to be ai companies..philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines. another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious and the associated ethical implications. many other topics in philosophy are relevant to ai such as epistemology and free will. rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of ai..alan turing wrote in  i propose to consider the question can machines think he advised changing the question from whether a machine thinks to whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour. he devised the turing test which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation. since we can only observe the behavior of the machine it does not matter if it is actually thinking or literally has a mind. turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks..russell and norvig agree with turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior not internal structure. however they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. aeronautical engineering texts they wrote do not define the goal of their field as making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons. ai founder john mccarthy agreed writing that artificial intelligence is not by definition simulation of human intelligence..mccarthy defines intelligence as the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world. another ai founder marvin minsky similarly describes it as the ability to solve hard problems. the leading ai textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals. these definitions view intelligence in terms of welldefined problems with welldefined solutions where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the intelligence of the machineand no other philosophical discussion is required or may not even be possible..another definition has been adopted by google a major practitioner in the field of ai. this definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence..some authors have suggested in practice that the definition of ai is vague and difficult to define with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as ai with many companies during the early s ai boom using the term as a marketing buzzword often even if they did not actually use ai in a material way..no established unifying theory or paradigm has guided ai research for most of its history. the unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the s eclipsed all other approaches so much so that some sources especially in the business world use the term artificial intelligence to mean machine learning with neural networks. this approach is mostly subsymbolic soft and narrow. critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of ai researchers..symbolic ai or gofai simulated the highlevel conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles express legal reasoning and do mathematics. they were highly successful at intelligent tasks such as algebra or iq tests. in the s newell and simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action..however the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily such as learning recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. moravecs paradox is the discovery that highlevel intelligent tasks were easy for ai but low level instinctive tasks were extremely difficult. philosopher hubert dreyfus had argued since the s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation and on having a feel for the situation rather than explicit symbolic knowledge. although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented eventually ai research came to agree with him..the issue is not resolved subsymbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does such as algorithmic bias. critics such as noam chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic ai will still be necessary to attain general intelligence in part because subsymbolic ai is a move away from explainable ai it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical ai program made a particular decision. the emerging field of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches..neats hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple elegant principles such as logic optimization or neural networks. scruffies expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. this issue was actively discussed in the s and s but eventually was seen as irrelevant. modern ai has elements of both..finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems. soft computing is a set of techniques including genetic algorithms fuzzy logic and neural networks that are tolerant of imprecision uncertainty partial truth and approximation. soft computing was introduced in the late s and most successful ai programs in the st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks..ai researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible narrow ai in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the fields longterm goals. general intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure and modern ai has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. the subfield of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively..there is no settled consensus in philosophy of mind on whether a machine can have a mind consciousness and mental states in the same sense that human beings do. this issue considers the internal experiences of the machine rather than its external behavior. mainstream ai research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. russell and norvig add that he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on. however the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. it is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction..david chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind which he named the hard and easy problems of consciousness. the easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals makes plans and controls behavior. the hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something dennetts consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion. while human information processing is easy to explain human subjective experience is difficult to explain. for example it is easy to imagine a colorblind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like..computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mindbody problem. this philosophical position was inspired by the work of ai researchers and cognitive scientists in the s and was originally proposed by philosophers jerry fodor and hilary putnam..philosopher john searle characterized this position as strong ai the appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. searle challenges this claim with his chinese room argument which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind..it is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced ai is sentient has the ability to feel and if so to what degree. but if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures similarly to animals. sapience a set of capacities related to high intelligence such as discernment or selfawareness may provide another moral basis for ai rights. robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society..in  the european union considered granting electronic personhood to some of the most capable ai systems. similarly to the legal status of companies it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities. critics argued in  that granting rights to ai systems would downplay the importance of human rights and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. they also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own..progress in ai increased interest in the topic. proponents of ai welfare and rights often argue that ai sentience if it emerges would be particularly easy to deny. they warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming which could lead to largescale suffering if sentient ai is created and carelessly exploited..a superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. if research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. the improved software would be even better at improving itself leading to what i. j. good called an intelligence explosion and vernor vinge called a singularity..however technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely and typically follow an sshaped curve slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do..robot designer hans moravec cyberneticist kevin warwick and inventor ray kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. this idea called transhumanism has roots in the writings of aldous huxley and robert ettinger..edward fredkin argues that artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution an idea first proposed by samuel butlers darwin among the machines as far back as  and expanded upon by george dyson in his  book darwin among the machines the evolution of global intelligence..thoughtcapable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity and have been a persistent theme in science fiction..a common trope in these works began with mary shelleys frankenstein where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. this includes such works as arthur c. clarkes and stanley kubricks  a space odyssey both  with hal  the murderous computer in charge of the discovery one spaceship as well as the terminator  and the matrix . in contrast the rare loyal robots such as gort from the day the earth stood still  and bishop from aliens  are less prominent in popular culture..isaac asimov introduced the three laws of robotics in many stories most notably with the multivac superintelligent computer. asimovs laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with asimovs laws through popular culture they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons one of which is their ambiguity..several works use ai to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel and thus to suffer. this appears in karel apeks r.u.r. the films a.i. artificial intelligence and ex machina as well as the novel do androids dream of electric sheep by philip k. dick. dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence..the two most widely used textbooks in  see the open syllabus.the four most widely used ai textbooks in .other textbooks..finance refers to monetary resources and to the study and discipline of money currency assets and liabilities. as a subject of study it is related to but distinct from economics which is the study of the production distribution and consumption of goods and services. based on the scope of financial activities in financial systems the discipline can be divided into personal corporate and public finance..in these financial systems assets are bought sold or traded as financial instruments such as currencies loans bonds shares stocks options futures etc. assets can also be banked invested and insured to maximize value and minimize loss. in practice risks are always present in any financial action and entities..due to its wide scope a broad range of subfields exists within finance. asset money risk and investment management aim to maximize value and minimize volatility. financial analysis assesses the viability stability and profitability of an action or entity. some fields are multidisciplinary such as mathematical finance financial law financial economics financial engineering and financial technology. these fields are the foundation of business and accounting. in some cases theories in finance can be tested using the scientific method covered by experimental finance..the early history of finance parallels the early history of money which is prehistoric. ancient and medieval civilizations incorporated basic functions of finance such as banking trading and accounting into their economies. in the late th century the global financial system was formed..in the middle of the th century finance emerged as a distinct academic discipline separate from economics. the earliest doctoral programs in finance were established in the s and s. today finance is also widely studied through careerfocused undergraduate and masters level programs..as outlined the financial system consists of the flows of capital that take place between individuals and households personal finance governments public finance and businesses corporate finance. finance thus studies the process of channeling money from savers and investors to entities that need it. savers and investors have money available which could earn interest or dividends if put to productive use. individuals companies and governments must obtain money from some external source such as loans or credit when they lack sufficient funds to run their operations..in general an entity whose income exceeds its expenditure can lend or invest the excess intending to earn a fair return. correspondingly an entity where income is less than expenditure can raise capital usually in one of two ways i by borrowing in the form of a loan private individuals or by selling government or corporate bonds ii by a corporation selling equity also called stock or shares which may take various forms preferred stock or common stock. the owners of both bonds and stock may be institutional investorsfinancial institutions such as investment banks and pension fundsor private individuals called private investors or retail investors. see financial market participants..the lending is often indirect through a financial intermediary such as a bank or via the purchase of notes or bonds corporate bonds government bonds or mutual bonds in the bond market. the lender receives interest the borrower pays a higher interest than the lender receives and the financial intermediary earns the difference for arranging the loan.a bank aggregates the activities of many borrowers and lenders. banks accept deposits from individuals and businesses paying interest on these funds. the bank then lends these deposits to borrowers. banks facilitate transactions between borrowers and lenders of various sizes enabling efficient financial coordination..investing typically entails the purchase of stock either individual securities or via a mutual fund for example. stocks are usually sold by corporations to investors so as to raise required capital in the form of equity financing as distinct from the debt financing described above. the financial intermediaries here are the investment banks which find the initial investors and facilitate the listing of the securities typically shares and bonds the securities exchanges which allow their trade thereafter and the various investment service providers including mutual funds pension funds wealth managers and stock brokers typically servicing retail investors..interinstitutional trade and investment and fundmanagement at this scale is referred to as wholesale finance.institutions here extend the products offered with related trading to include bespoke options swaps and structured products as well as specialized financing this financial engineering is inherently mathematical and these institutions are then the major employers of quantitative analysts or quants see below. in these institutions risk management regulatory capital and compliance play major roles..as outlined finance comprises broadly the three areas of personal finance corporate finance and public finance. these in turn overlap and employ various activities and subdisciplineschiefly investments risk management and quantitative finance..personal finance refers to the practice of budgeting to ensure enough funds are available to meet basic needs while ensuring there is only a reasonable level of risk to lose said capital. personal finance may involve paying for education financing durable goods such as real estate and cars buying insurance investing and saving for retirement. personal finance may also involve paying for a loan or other debt obligations. the main areas of personal finance are considered to be income spending saving investing and protection. the following steps as outlined by the financial planning standards board suggest that an individual will understand a potentially secure personal finance plan after.corporate finance deals with the actions that managers take to increase the value of the firm to the shareholders the sources of funding and the capital structure of corporations and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. while corporate finance is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms rather than corporations alone the concepts are applicable to the financial problems of all firms and this area is then often referred to as business finance..typically corporate finance relates to the long term objective of maximizing the value of the entitys assets its stock and its return to shareholders while also balancing risk and profitability. this entails three primary areas.the latter creates the link with investment banking and securities trading as above in that the capital raised will generically comprise debt i.e. corporate bonds and equity often listed shares. re risk management within corporates see below..financial managersi.e. as distinct from corporate financiersfocus more on the short term elements of profitability cash flow and working capital management inventory credit and debtors which is concerned about the daily funding operations and the goal is to maintain liquidity minimize risk and maximize efficiency ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its financial and operational objectives i.e. that it  can service both maturing shortterm debt repayments and scheduled longterm debt payments and  has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses. see financial management and fpa. .public finance describes finance as related to sovereign states subnational entities and related public entities or agencies. it generally encompasses a longterm strategic perspective regarding investment decisions that affect public entities. these longterm strategic periods typically encompass five or more years. public finance is primarily concerned with.central banks such as the federal reserve system banks in the united states and the bank of england in the united kingdom are strong players in public finance. they act as lenders of last resort as well as strong influences on monetary and credit conditions in the economy..development finance which is related concerns investment in economic development projects provided by a quasi governmental institution on a noncommercial basis these projects would otherwise not be able to get financing. a publicprivate partnership is primarily used for infrastructure projects a private sector corporate provides the financing upfront and then draws profits from taxpayers or users.climate finance and the related environmental finance address the financial strategies resources and instruments used in climate change mitigation..investment management is the professional asset management of various securitiestypically shares and bonds but also other assets such as real estate commodities and alternative investmentsin order to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors..as above investors may be institutions such as insurance companies pension funds corporations charities educational establishments or private investors either directly via investment contracts or more commonly via collective investment schemes like mutual funds exchangetraded funds or real estate investment trusts..at the heart of investment management is asset allocationdiversifying the exposure among these asset classes and among individual securities within each asset classas appropriate to the clients investment policy in turn a function of risk profile investment goals and investment horizon see investor profile. here.overlaid is the portfolio managers investment stylebroadly active vs passive value vs growth and small cap vs. large capand investment strategy..in a welldiversified portfolio achieved investment performance will in general largely be a function of the asset mix selected while the individual securities are less impactful. the specific approach or philosophy will also be significant depending on the extent to which it is complementary with the market cycle..additional to this diversification the fundamental risk mitigant employed investment managers will apply various hedging techniques as appropriate these may relate to the portfolio as a whole or to individual stocks. bond portfolios are often instead managed via cash flow matching or immunization while for derivative portfolios and positions traders use the greeks to measure and then offset sensitivities. in parallel managers  active and passive  will monitor tracking error thereby minimizing and preempting any underperformance vs their benchmark..a quantitative fund is managed using computerbased mathematical techniques increasingly machine learning instead of human judgment. the actual trading is typically automated via sophisticated algorithms..risk management in general is the study of how to control risks and balance the possibility of gains it is the process of measuring risk and then developing and implementing strategies to manage that risk.financial risk management is the practice of protecting corporate value against financial risks often by hedging exposure to these using financial instruments. the focus is particularly on credit and market risk and in banks through regulatory capital includes operational risk..financial risk management is related to corporate finance in two ways. firstly firm exposure to market risk is a direct result of previous capital investments and funding decisions while credit risk arises from the businesss credit policy and is often addressed through credit insurance and provisioning.  secondly both disciplines share the goal of enhancing or at least preserving the firms economic value and in this context overlaps also enterprise risk management typically the domain of strategic management.  here businesses devote much time and effort to forecasting analytics and performance monitoring. see alm and treasury management..for banks and other wholesale institutions risk management focuses on managing and as necessary hedging the various positions held by the institutionboth trading positions and long term exposuresand on calculating and monitoring the resultant economic capital and regulatory capital under basel iii. the calculations here are mathematically sophisticated and within the domain of quantitative finance as below. credit risk is inherent in the business of banking but additionally these institutions are exposed to counterparty credit risk. banks typically employ middle office risk groups whereas front office risk teams provide risk services or solutions to customers..insurers manage their own risks with a focus on solvency and the ability to pay claims life insurers are concerned more with longevity risk and interest rate risk shortterm insurers property healthcasualty emphasize catastrophe and claims volatility risks. for expected claims reserves are set aside periodically while to absorb unexpected losses a minimum level of capital is maintained..quantitative financealso referred to as mathematical financeincludes those finance activities where a sophisticated mathematical model is required and thus overlaps several of the above..as a specialized practice area quantitative finance comprises primarily three subdisciplines the underlying theory and techniques are discussed in the next section.dcf valuation formula widely applied in business and finance since articulated in . here to get the value of the firm its forecasted free cash flows are discounted to the present using the weighted average cost of capital for the discount factor.for share valuation investors use the related dividend discount model..financial theory is studied and developed within the disciplines of management financial economics accountancy and applied mathematics.in the abstract finance is concerned with the investment and deployment of assets and liabilities over space and time i.e. it is about performing valuation and asset allocation today based on the risk and uncertainty of future outcomes while appropriately incorporating the time value of money.determining the present value of these future values discounting must be at the riskappropriate discount rate in turn a major focus of financetheory.as financial theory has roots in many disciplines including mathematics statistics economics physics and psychology it can be considered a mix of an art and science and there are ongoing related efforts to organize a list of unsolved problems in finance..managerial financeis the branch of finance that deals with the financial aspects of the management of a company and the financial dimension of managerial decisionmaking more broadly. it provides the theoretical underpin for the practice described above concerning itself with the managerial application of the various finance techniques. academics working in this area are typically based in business school finance departments in accounting or in management science..the tools addressed and developed relate in the main to managerial accounting and corporate financethe former allow management to better understand and hence act on financial information relating to profitability and performance the latter as above are about optimizing the overall financial structure including its impact on working capital. key aspects of managerial finance thus include.the discussion however extends to business strategy more broadly emphasizing alignment with the companys overall strategic objectives and similarly incorporates the managerial perspectives of planning directing and controlling..financial economics is the branch of economics that studies the interrelation of financial variables such as prices interest rates and shares as opposed to real economic variables i.e. goods and services. it thus centers on pricing decision making and risk management in the financial markets and produces many of the commonly employed financial models. financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterize the relationships suggested..the discipline has two main areas of focus asset pricing and corporate finance the first being the perspective of providers of capital i.e. investors and the second of users of capital respectively.financial mathematics is the field of applied mathematics concerned with financial marketslouis bacheliers doctoral thesis defended in  is considered to be the first scholarly work in this area. the field is largely focused on the modeling of derivativeswith much emphasis on interest rate and credit risk modelingwhile other important areas include insurance mathematics and quantitative portfolio management. relatedly the techniques developed are applied to pricing and hedging a wide range of assetbacked government and corporatesecurities..as above in terms of practice the field is referred to as quantitative finance and  or mathematical finance and comprises primarily the three areas discussed.the main mathematical tools and techniques are correspondingly.mathematically these separate into two analytic branches derivatives pricing uses riskneutral probability or arbitragepricing probability denoted by q while risk and portfolio management generally use physical or actual or actuarial probability denoted by p. these are interrelated through the above fundamental theorem of asset pricing..the subject has a close relationship with financial economics which as outlined is concerned with much of the underlying theory that is involved in financial mathematics  generally financial mathematics will derive and extend the mathematical models suggested. computational finance is the branch of applied computer science that deals with problems of practical interest in finance and especially emphasizes the numerical methods applied here..experimental finance aims to establish different market settings and environments to experimentally observe and provide a lens through which science can analyze agents behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows information diffusion and aggregation price setting mechanisms and returns processes. researchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and therefore prove them as well as attempt to discover new principles on which such theory can be extended and be applied to future financial decisions. research may proceed by conducting trading simulations or by establishing and studying the behavior of people in artificial competitive marketlike settings..behavioral finance studies how the psychology of investors or managers affects financial decisions and marketsand is relevant when making a decision that can impact either negatively or positively on one of their areas. with more indepth research into behavioral finance it is possible to bridge what actually happens in financial markets with analysis based on financial theory. behavioral finance has grown over the last few decades to become an integral aspect of finance. nowadays there is a need for more theory and testing of the effects of feelings on financial decisions. especially because now the time has come to move beyond behavioral finance to social finance which studies the structure of social interactions how financial ideas spread and how social processes affect financial decisions and outcomes..behavioral finance includes such topics as.a strand of behavioral finance has been dubbed quantitative behavioral finance which uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation..quantum finance involves applying quantum mechanical approaches to financial theory providing novel methods and perspectives in the field. quantum finance is an interdisciplinary field in which theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists are applied to solve financial problems. it represents a branch known as econophysics. although quantum computational methods have been around for quite some time and use the basic principles of physics to better understand the ways to implement and manage cash flows it is mathematics that is actually important in this new scenario finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. as a result numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. this research area is known as computational finance. many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. in particular when it comes to option pricing there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. for example in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market. as a result the finance community is always looking for ways to overcome the resulting performance issues that arise when pricing options. this has led to research that applies alternative computing techniques to finance. most commonly used quantum financial models are quantum continuous model quantum binomial model multistep quantum binomial model etc..the origin of finance can be traced to the beginning of state formation and trade during the bronze age. the earliest historical evidence of finance is dated to around  bce. banking originated in west asia where temples and palaces were used as safe places for the storage of valuables. initially the only valuable that could be deposited was grain but cattle and precious materials were eventually included. during the same period the sumerian city of uruk in mesopotamia supported trade by lending as well as the use of interest. in sumerian interest was mas which translates to calf. in greece and egypt the words used for interest tokos and ms respectively meant to give birth. in these cultures interest indicated a valuable increase and seemed to consider it from the lenders point of view. the code of hammurabi  bce included laws governing banking operations. the babylonians were accustomed to charging interest at the rate of  percent per year. by  bce cowrie shells were used as a form of money in china..the use of coins as a means of representing money began in the years between  and  bce. herodotus mentions the use of crude coins in lydia around  bce and by  bce the lydians had started to use coin money more widely and opened permanent retail shops. shortly after cities in classical greece such as aegina athens and corinth started minting their own coins between  and  bce. during the roman republic interest was outlawed by the lex genucia reforms in  bce though the provision went largely unenforced. under julius caesar a ceiling on interest rates of  was set and much later under justinian it was lowered even further to between  and ..the first stock exchange was opened in antwerp in . since then popular exchanges such as the london stock exchange founded in  and the new york stock exchange founded in  were created....a cryptocurrency colloquially crypto is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority such as a government or bank to uphold or maintain it..individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or blockchain which is a computerized database that uses a consensus mechanism to secure transaction records control the creation of additional coins and verify the transfer of coin ownership. the two most common consensus mechanisms are proof of work and proof of stake. despite the name which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdictions including classification as commodities securities and currencies. cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice..the first cryptocurrency was bitcoin which was first released as opensource software in . as of june  there were more than  other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace of which more than  had a market capitalization exceeding billion. as of april  the cryptocurrency market capitalization was already estimated at . trillion..in  american cryptographer david chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash. later in  he implemented it through digicash an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient. this allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party..in  the national security agency published a paper entitled how to make a mint the cryptography of anonymous electronic cash describing a cryptocurrency system. the paper was first published in an mit mailing list october  and later april  in the american law review..in  wei dai described bmoney an anonymous distributed electronic cash system. shortly thereafter nick szabo described bit gold. like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it bit gold not to be confused with the later goldbased exchange bitgold was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published..in january  bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer satoshi nakamoto. it used sha a cryptographic hash function in its proofofwork scheme. in april  namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized dns. in october  litecoin was released which used scrypt as its hash function instead of sha. peercoin created in august  used a hybrid of proofofwork and proofofstake..cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction including several bubbles and market crashes such as in    and ..on  august  the uk announced its treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role if any they could play in the uk economy. the study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered. its final report was published in  and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in january ..in june  el salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender after the legislative assembly had voted  to pass a bill submitted by president nayib bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such..in august  cuba followed with resolution  to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin..in september  the government of china the single largest market for cryptocurrency declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal. this completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within china..on  september  the worlds second largest cryptocurrency at that time ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proofofwork pow to proofofstake pos in an upgrade process known as the merge.  according to the ethereum founder the upgrade would cut both ethereums energy use and carbondioxide emissions by ...on  november  ftx trading ltd. a cryptocurrency exchange which also operated a crypto hedge fund and had been valued at  billion filed for bankruptcy. the financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate ftx customer base as reported while at a reuters conference financial industry executives said that regulators must step in to protect crypto investors. technology analyst avivah litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that everything...needs to improve dramatically in terms of user experience controls safety customer service..according to jan lansky a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions.in march  the word cryptocurrency was added to the merriamwebster dictionary..after the early innovation of bitcoin in  and the early network effect gained by bitcoin tokens cryptocurrencies and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the s as alternative cryptocurrencies or altcoins.sometimes the term alt coins was used or disparagingly shitcoins. paul vigna of the wall street journal described altcoins in  as alternative versions of bitcoin given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers. a polytechnic university of catalonia thesis in  used a broader description including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. as of early  there were more than  cryptocurrencies.. altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin. for example litecoin aims to process a block every . minutes rather than bitcoins  minutes which allows litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin. another example is ethereum which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain. ethereum was the most used blockchain in  according to bloomberg news. in  it had the largest following of any altcoin according to the new york times..significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an altseason..stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power. notably these designs are not foolproof as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg. for example on  may  terras stablecoin ust fell from  to  cents. the subsequent failure of terraform labs resulted in the loss of nearly b invested in the terra and luna coins. in september  south korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an interpol red notice against the companys founder do kwon. in hong kong the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in  is being shaped and includes a few considerations..memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from internet memes or jokes. the most notable example is dogecoin a memecoin featuring the shiba inu dog from the doge meme. memecoins are known for extreme volatility for example the recordhigh value for a dogecoin was  cents but that had plunged to  cents by mid. scams are prolific among memecoins..physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles. some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars. there have also been attempts to issue bitcoin bank notes..the term physical bitcoin is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a custodian..these physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves these are only utilized for collectable purposes. for example the first incarnation of the bitcoin casascius coins made of silver brass or aluminum sometimes with gold plating or titan bitcoin which in silver or gold versions are sought after by numismatists..cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated. in centralized banking and economic systems such as the us federal reserve system corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency. in the case of cryptocurrency companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms banks or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it. the underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by satoshi nakamoto..within a proofofwork system such as bitcoin the safety integrity and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners. miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme. in a proofofstake blockchain transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency sometimes grouped together in stake pools..most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation. compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement..the validity of each cryptocurrencys coins is provided by a blockchain. a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography. each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data. by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. a blockchain is an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. for use as a distributed ledger a blockchain is typically managed by a peertopeer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. once recorded the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks which requires collusion of the network majority..blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance. decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain..a node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. the node supports the cryptocurrencys network through either relaying transactions validation or hosting a copy of the blockchain. in terms of relaying transactions each network computer node has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports. when a transaction is made the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction and every other transaction is known..node owners are either volunteers those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network..cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to prove the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party..the first timestamping scheme invented was the proofofwork scheme. the most widely used proofofwork schemes are based on sha and scrypt..some other hashing algorithms that are used for proofofwork include cryptonote blake sha and x..another method is called the proofofstake scheme. proofofstake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. it is different from proofofwork systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. the scheme is largely dependent on the coin and there is currently no standard form of it. some cryptocurrencies use a combined proofofwork and proofofstake scheme..on a blockchain mining is the validation of transactions. for this effort successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. the rate of generating hashes which validate any transaction has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as fpgas and asics running complex hashing algorithms like sha and scrypt. this arms race for cheaperyetefficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in . mining is measured by hash rate typically in ths. a  imf working paper found that crypto mining could generate  million tons of co emissions by  accounting for . percent of global emissions or . percent of the world total.with more people entering the world of virtual currency generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. consequently the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities to mitigate the heat the equipment produces and the electricity required to run them. popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity a cold climate and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. by july  bitcoins electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately  gigawatts around . of the global total or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by switzerland..some miners pool resources sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. a share is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proofofwork..as of february the chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency banned initial coin offerings and shut down mining. many chinese miners have since relocated to canada and texas. one company is operating data centers for mining operations at canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices. in june  hydro quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate  megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining. according to a february  report from fortune iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity..in march  the city of plattsburgh new york put an month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the character and direction of the city. in  kazakhstan became the secondbiggest cryptocurrency mining country producing . of the global exahash rate. the country built a compound containing  computers near ekibastuz..an increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards gpu in . the computing power of gpus makes them wellsuited to generating hashes. popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners such as nvidias gtx  and gtx  graphics cards as well as amds rx  and rx  gpus doubled or tripled in price or were out of stock. a gtx  ti which was released at a price of  sold for as much as . another popular card the gtx   gb model was released at an msrp of  and sold for almost . rx  and rx  cards from amd were out of stock for almost a year. miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new gpus as soon as they are available..nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling gpus to gamers instead of miners. boris bhles pr manager for nvidia in the german region said gamers come first for nvidia..numerous companies developed dedicated cryptomining accelerator chips capable of priceperformance far higher than that of cpu or gpu mining. at one point intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip named blockscale..a cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private keys address or seed which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency. with the private key it is possible to write in the public ledger effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. with the public key it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet..there exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet. these methods range from using paper wallets which are public private or seed keys written on paper to using hardware wallets which are hardware to store your wallet information to a digital wallet which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext..bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than anonymous the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys or addresses. thereby bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain. still cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users..some cryptocurrencies such as monero zerocoin zerocash and cryptonote implement additional measures to increase privacy such as by using zeroknowledge proofs..a recent  study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies. the attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards. in order to improve privacy researchers suggested several different ideas including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the ip address of the source..cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the internet..proofofwork cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin offer block rewards incentives for miners. there has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances..the rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. by making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. the verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power and thus electricity in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate the public blockchain. not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. generally the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs but this may not always be the case..the current value not the longterm value of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities. in  bitcoins design caused a . welfare loss compared to an efficient cash system while a cash system with  money growth has a minor . welfare cost. the main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost which is estimated to be us million per year. this translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of  before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. however the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether..transaction fees sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction. the ability for the holder to be allowed to set the fee manually often depends on the wallet software used and central exchanges for cryptocurrency cex usually do not allow the customer to set a custom transaction fee for the transaction. their wallet software such as coinbase wallet however might support adjusting the fee..select cryptocurrency exchanges have offered to let the user choose between different presets of transaction fee values during the currency conversion. one of those exchanges namely litebit previously headquartered in the netherlands was forced to cease all operations on august th  due to market changes and regulatory pressure..the recommended fee suggested by the network will often depend on the time of day due to depending on network load..for ethereum transaction fees differ by computational complexity bandwidth use and storage needs while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses segwit. in february  the median transaction fee for ether corresponded to . while for bitcoin it corresponded to ...some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees the most wellknown example being nano xno and instead rely on clientside proofofwork as the transaction prioritization and antispam mechanism..cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets such as conventional fiat money or to trade between different digital currencies..crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price. as a result as of  it was possible to arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets..atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party such as an exchange..jordan kelley founder of robocoin launched the first bitcoin atm in the united states on  february . the kiosk installed in austin texas is similar to bank atms but has scanners to read governmentissued identification such as a drivers license or a passport to confirm users identities..an initial coin offering ico is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. an ico may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. however securities regulators in many jurisdictions including in the u.s. and canada have indicated that if a coin or token is an investment contract e.g. under the howey test i.e. an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. in an ico campaign a percentage of the cryptocurrency usually in the form of tokens is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies often bitcoin or ether..according to pricewaterhousecoopers four of the  biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used switzerland as a base where they are frequently registered as nonprofit foundations. the swiss regulatory agency finma stated that it would take a balanced approach to ico projects and would allow legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system. in response to numerous requests by industry representatives a legislative ico working group began to issue legal guidelines in  which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices..the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. the total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least  of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin. bitcoins value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself. the cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the halving which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin. as the date reaches near of a halving twice thus far historically the cryptocurrency market cap increases followed by a downtrend..by june  cryptocurrency had begun to be offered by some wealth managers in the us for ks..cryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks. for example over one week in may  bitcoin lost  of its value and ethereum lost  while solana and cardano lost  and  respectively. the falls were attributed to warnings about inflation. by comparison in the same week the nasdaq tech stock index fell . per cent and the ftse  was . per cent down..in the longer term of the  leading cryptocurrencies identified by the total value of coins in circulation in january  only four bitcoin ethereum cardano and ripple xrp were still in that position in early . the total value of all cryptocurrencies was   trillion at the end of  but had halved nine months later. the wall street journal has commented that the crypto sector has become intertwined with the rest of the capital markets and sensitive to the same forces that drive tech stocks and other risk assets such as inflation forecasts..there are also centralized databases outside of blockchains that store crypto market data. compared to the blockchain databases perform fast as there is no verification process. four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are coinmarketcap coingecko bravenewcoin and cryptocompare..according to alan feuer of the new york times libertarians and anarchocapitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin. early bitcoin supporter roger ver said at first almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. we saw bitcoin as a great idea as a way to separate money from the state. economist paul krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are something of a cult based in paranoid fantasies of government power..david golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from rightwing extremist movements such as the liberty lobby and the john birch society and their anticentral bank rhetoric or more recently ron paul and tea partystyle libertarianism. steve bannon who owns a good stake in bitcoin sees cryptocurrency as a form of disruptive populism taking control back from central authorities..bitcoins founder satoshi nakamoto supported the idea that cryptocurrencies go well with libertarianism. its very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly nakamoto said in ..according to the european central bank the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the austrian school of economics especially with friedrich von hayek in his book denationalisation of money the argument refined in which hayek advocates a complete free market in the production distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks..the rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. the financial action task force fatf has defined cryptocurrencyrelated services as virtual asset service providers vasps and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering aml and know your customer kyc requirements as financial institutions..in may  the joint working group on intervasp messaging standards published ivms  a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between vasps. the fatf and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed..in june  fatf updated its guidance to include the travel rule for cryptocurrencies a measure which mandates that vasps obtain hold and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers. subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using json for relaying data between vasps and identity services. as of december  the ivms  data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it..the european commission published a digital finance strategy in september . this included a draft regulation on markets in cryptoassets mica which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the eu..on  june  the basel committee on banking supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. for instance if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth  billion it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire  billion. this is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. however this is a proposal and not a regulation..the imf is seeking a coordinated consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies. tobias adrian the imfs financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a january  interview that agreeing global regulations is never quick. but if we start now we can achieve the goal of maintaining financial stability while also enjoying the benefits which the underlying technological innovations bring.in may   years after the advent of the first blockchain bitcoin the us congress advanced a bill to the full house of representatives to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets. the financial innovation and technology for the st century act which defines responsibilities between various us agencies notably between the commodity futures trading commission cftc for decentralized blockchains and the securities and exchange commission sec for blockchains that are functional but not decentralized.  stablecoins are excluded from both cftc and sec regulation in this bill except for fraud and certain activities by registered firms..in september  china banned icos to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window. the liquidity changes by banning icos in china was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news..on  may  china banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services. this led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies. for instance bitcoin fell  ethereum fell  binance coin fell  and dogecoin fell . proof of work mining was the next focus with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create bitcoin and ethereum..in september  the chinese government declared all cryptocurrency transactions of any kind illegal completing its crackdown on cryptocurrency..in april  tvnzs news reported that the cook islands government was proposing legislation that would allow recovery agents to use various means including hacking to investigate or find cryptocurrency that may have been used for illegal means or is the proceeds of crime. the tainted cryptocurrency recovery bill was drafted by two lawyers hired by usbased debt collection company drumcliffe. the proposed legislation was criticised by cook islands crown laws deputy solicitor general david greig who described it as flawed and said that some provisions were clearly unconstitutional. the cook islands financial services development authority described drumcliffes involvement as a conflict of interest..similar criticism was echoed by auckland university of technology cryptocurrency specialist and senior lecturer jeff nijsse and university of otago political scientist professor robert patman who described it as government overreach and described it as inconsistent with international law. since the cook islands is an associated state that is part of the realm of new zealand patman said that the law would have implications for new zealands governance arrangements. a spokesperson for new zealand foreign minister winston peters confirmed that new zealand officials were discussing the legislation with their cook islands counterparts.  cook islands prime minister mark brown defended the legislation as part of the territorys fight against international cybercrime..on  june  el salvador announced that it will adopt bitcoin as legal tender becoming the first country to do so..the eu defines crypto assets as a digital representation of a value or of a right that is able to be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology or similar technology. the eu regulation markets in cryptoassets mica covering assetreferenced tokens arts and electronic money tokens emts also known as stablecoins came into force on  june . as of  january  the european securities and markets authority esma issued guidance to cryptoasset service providers casps allowing them to maintain cryptoasset services for noncompliant arts and emts until the end of march ..the rest of mica came into force as of  december  covering cryptoassets other than art and emt and casps. mica excludes cryptoassets if they qualify as financial instruments according to esma guidelines published on  december  as well as cryptoassets that are unique and not fungible with other cryptoassets..at present india neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market. in  the supreme court of india had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency which was imposed by the reserve bank of india. since then an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime. but it is being contemplated that the indian parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in india. expressing his public policy opinion on the indian cryptocurrency market to a wellknown online publication a leading public policy lawyer and vice president of saarclaw south asian association for regional cooperation in law hemant batra has said that the cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment. he mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it. he favoured following imf and fatf guidelines in this regard..south africa which has seen a large number of scams related to cryptocurrency is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place that will produce a regulatory framework. the largest scam occurred in april  where the two founders of an africanbased cryptocurrency exchange called africrypt raees cajee and ameer cajee disappeared with . billion worth of bitcoin. additionally mirror trading international disappeared with  million worth of cryptocurrency in january ..in march  south korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets. this legislation requires all digital asset managers providers and exchanges to be registered with the korea financial intelligence unit in order to operate in south korea. registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the information security management system and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts. it also requires that the ceo and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks..switzerland was one of the first countries to implement the fatfs travel rule. finma the swiss regulator issued its own guidance to vasps in . the guidance followed the fatfs recommendation  however with stricter requirements. according to finmas requirements vasps need to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer..on  april  the central bank of the republic of turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks..in the united kingdom as of  january  all cryptocurrency firms such as exchanges advisors and professionals that have either a presence market product or provide services within the uk market must register with the financial conduct authority. additionally on  june  the financial watchdog demanded that binance cease all regulated activities in the uk..the incoming labour government confirmed in november  that it will proceed with the regulation of cryptoassets and new uk requirements are expected to come into force in ..in   states in the us passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation. this led the securities and exchange commission to start considering what steps to take. on  july  senator elizabeth warren part of the senate banking committee wrote to the chairman of the sec and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers. on  august  the chairman gary gensler responded to warrens letter and called for legislation focused on crypto trading lending and defi platforms because of how vulnerable investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker. he also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight. additionally gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins. these tokens which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems such as antimoney laundering tax compliance and sanctions..on  october  the first bitcoinlinked exchangetraded fund etf from proshares started trading on the nyse under the ticker bito. proshares ceo michael l. sapir said the etf would expose bitcoin to a wider range of investors without the hassle of setting up accounts with cryptocurrency providers. ian balina the ceo of token metrics stated that sec approval of the etf was a significant endorsement for the crypto industry because many regulators globally were not in favor of crypto and retail investors were hesitant to accept crypto. this event would eventually open more opportunities for new capital and new people in this space..the department of the treasury on  may  announced that it would require any transfer worth  or more to be reported to the internal revenue service since cryptocurrency already posed a problem where illegal activity like tax evasion was facilitated broadly. this release from the irs was a part of efforts to promote better compliance and consider more severe penalties for tax evaders..on  february  the department of justice named eun young choi as the first director of a national cryptocurrency

value of the attempted shot.', 'a player fouled while attempting a regular twopoint shot thus receives two shots and a player fouled while attempting a threepoint shot receives three shots..if a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point.', 'in combination with a regular shot this is called a threepoint play or fourpoint play or more colloquially an and one because of the basket made at the time of the foul  or  points and the additional free throw  point..although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever they have evolved as part of basketball.', 'during the early years of basketballs evolution two guards two forwards and one center were used.', 'in more recent times specific positions evolved but the current trend advocated by many top coaches including mike krzyzewski is towards positionless basketball where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it.', 'popular descriptions of positions include.point guard often called the  usually the fastest player on the team organizes the teams offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time..shooting guard the  creates a high volume of shots on offense mainly longranged and guards the opponents best perimeter player on defense..small forward the  often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration on defense seeks rebounds and steals but sometimes plays more actively..power forward the  plays offensively often with their back to the basket on defense plays under the basket in a zone defense or against the opposing power forward in mantoman defense..center the  uses height and size to score on offense to protect the basket closely on defense or to rebound..the above descriptions are flexible.', 'for most teams today the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings as do the power forward and center who are often called post players.', 'while most teams describe two players as guards two as forwards and one as a center on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations..there are two main defensive strategies zone defense and mantoman defense.', 'in a zone defense each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court.', 'zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball a manoeuver known as a trap.', 'in a mantoman defense each defensive player guards a specific opponent..offensive plays are more varied normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball.', 'a quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut.', 'a legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate by standing in the defenders way such that the teammate cuts next to him is a screen or pick.', 'the two plays are combined in the pick and roll in which a player sets a pick and then rolls away from the pick towards the basket.', 'screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket.', 'teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable.', 'on court the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur..shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket methods varying with players and situations..typically a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket.', 'a player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand the shooting arm slightly above the head with the other hand supporting the side of the ball.', 'the ball is usually shot by jumping though not always and extending the shooting arm.', 'the shooting arm fully extended with the wrist fully bent is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball known as a followthrough.', 'players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.', 'the ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial but generally a proper arc is recommended.', 'players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket..the two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot.', 'both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot.', 'in a set shot the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor this is typically used for free throws.', 'for a jump shot the throw is taken in midair with the ball being released near the top of the jump.', 'this provides much greater power and range and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.', 'failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation..another common shot is called the layup.', 'this shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket and to lay the ball up and into the basket typically off the backboard the backboardfree underhand version is called a finger roll.', 'the most crowdpleasing and typically highestpercentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward through the basket while touching it..another shot that is less common than the layup is the circus shot.', 'the circus shot is a lowpercentage shot that is flipped heaved scooped or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is offbalance airborne falling down or facing away from the basket.', 'a backshot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket and may be shot with the dominant hand or both but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful..a shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball.', 'a particularly bad shot or one that only hits the backboard is jocularly called a brick.', 'the hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping either to make a slam dunk layup or jump shot..the objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard.', 'this plays a major role in the game as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.', 'there are two categories of rebounds offensive rebounds in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession and defensive rebounds in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.', 'the majority of rebounds are defensive as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots for example about  of rebounds in the nba are defensive..a pass is a method of moving the ball between players.', 'most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy..a staple pass is the chest pass.', 'the ball is passed directly from the passers chest to the receivers chest.', 'a proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react..another type of pass is the bounce pass.', 'here the passer bounces the ball crisply about twothirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver.', 'the ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver.', 'the bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept kicking the ball deliberately is a violation.', 'thus players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments or to pass around a defender..the overhead pass is used to pass the ball over a defender.', 'the ball is released while over the passers head..the outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound.', 'the next pass after the rebound is the outlet pass..the crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept.', 'good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball.', 'a special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate.', 'this is called a nolook pass..another advanced style of passing is the behindtheback pass which as the description implies involves throwing the ball behind the passers back to a teammate.', 'although some players can perform such a pass effectively many coaches discourage nolook or behindtheback passes believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations..dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball.', 'to dribble a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it this ensures greater control..when dribbling past an opponent the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball.', 'it is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands..good dribblers or ball handlers tend to keep their dribbling hand low to the ground reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand making it more difficult for the defender to steal the ball.', 'good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs between their legs and switch directions suddenly making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against.', 'this is called a crossover which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling..a skilled player can dribble without watching the ball using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the balls location.', 'by not having to focus on the ball a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from himher..a block is performed when after a shot is attempted a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball.', 'in almost all variants of play it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc this is known as goaltending.', 'it is also illegal under nba and mens ncaa basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim.', 'under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim.', 'after the ball hits the rim it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed..to block a shot a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released.', 'thus height can be an advantage in blocking.', 'players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions.', 'however with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap even shorter players can be effective shot blockers..at the professional level most male players are above feet inches .m and most women above feet inches .m.', 'guards for whom physical coordination and ballhandling skills are crucial tend to be the smallest players.', 'almost all forwards in the top mens pro leagues are feet inches .m or taller.', 'most centers are over feet inches .m tall.', 'according to a survey given to all nba teams the average height of all nba players is just under feet inches .m with the average weight being close to  pounds kg.', 'the tallest players ever in the nba were manute bol and gheorghe murean who were both feet inches .m tall.', 'at feet inches .m margo dydek was the tallest player in the history of the wnba..the shortest player ever to play in the nba is muggsy bogues at feet inches .m.', 'other averageheight or relatively short players have thrived at the pro level including anthony spud webb who was feet inches .m tall but had a inch .m vertical leap giving him significant height when jumping and temeka johnson who won the wnba rookie of the year award and a championship with the phoenix mercury while standing only feet inches .m.', 'while shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths..players regularly inflate their height in high school or college.', 'many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts who prefer taller players.', 'charles barkley stated ive been measured at  .', 'but i started in college at .', 'sam smith a former writer from the chicago tribune said we sort of know the heights because after camp the sheet comes out.', 'but you use that height and the player gets mad.', 'and then you hear from his agent.', 'or you file your story with the right height and the copy desk changes it because they have the official n.b.a.', 'media guide which is wrong.', 'so you sort of go along with the joke..since the  nba season heights of nba players are recorded definitively by measuring players with their shoes off..variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball using common basketball skills and equipment primarily the ball and basket.', 'some variations only have superficial rule changes while others are distinct games with varying degrees of influence from basketball.', 'other variations include childrens games contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills..an earlier version of basketball played primarily by women and girls was sixonsix basketball.', 'horseball is a game played on horseback where a ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net approximately .m.m.', 'the sport is like a combination of polo rugby and basketball.', 'there is even a form played on donkeys known as donkey basketball which has attracted criticism from animal rights groups..perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the halfcourt game played in informal settings without referees or strict rules.', 'only one basket is used and the ball must be taken back or cleared  passed or dribbled outside the threepoint line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the other.', 'halfcourt games require less cardiovascular stamina since players need not run back and forth a full court.', 'halfcourt raises the number of players that can use a court or conversely can be played if there is an insufficient number to form full on teams..halfcourt basketball is usually played on on

the conference but later declined to ratify the final agreements charging that the institutions they had created were branches of wall street.', 'these organizations became operational in  after a sufficient number of countries had ratified the agreement.', 'according to barry eichengreen the bretton woods system operated successfully due to three factors low international capital mobility tight financial regulation and the dominant economic and financial position of the united states and the dollar..eurodollar growth increased capital flows challenging regulation of capital

'shortly thereafter many fixed currencies such as the pound sterling also became freefloating and the subsequent era has been characterized by floating exchange rates.', 'the end of bretton woods was formally ratified by the jamaica accords in ..the planners at bretton woods hoped to avoid a repetition of the treaty of versailles after world war i which had created enough economic and political tension to lead to wwii.', 'after world war i britain owed the u.s. substantial sums which britain could not repay because it had used the funds to support allies such as france during the war the allies could not pay back britain so britain could not pay back the u.s. the solution at versailles for the french british and americans seemed to entail ultimately charging germany for the debts.', 'if the demands on germany were unrealistic then it was unrealistic for france to pay back britain and for britain to pay back the us.', 'thus many assets on bank balance sheets internationally were actually unrecoverable loans which culminated in the  banking crisis.', 'intransigent insistence by creditor countries for the repayment of allied war debts and reparations combined with an inclination to isolationism led to a breakdown of the international financial system and a worldwide economic depression..the beggar thy neighbour policies that emerged as the crisis continued saw some trading countries using currency devaluations in an attempt to increase their competitiveness i.e.', 'raise exports and lower imports though recent research suggests this de facto inflationary

inconsistent  that emerged over the first half of the decade worked inconsistently and selfdefeatingly to promote national import substitution increase national exports divert foreign investment and trade flows and even prevent certain categories of crossborder trade and investment outright.', 'global central bankers attempted to manage the situation by meeting with each other but their understanding of the situation as well as difficulties in communicating internationally hindered their abilities.', 'the lesson was that simply having responsible hardworking central bankers was not enough..britain in the s had an exclusionary trade bloc with countries and territories of the british empire known as the sterling area.', 'if britain imported more than it exported to such trading partners recipients of pounds sterling within these countries tended to put them into london banks.', 'this meant that though britain was running a trade deficit it had a financial account surplus and payments balanced.', 'increasingly britains positive balance of payments required keeping the wealth from across its empire in british banks.', 'one incentive for say south african holders of rand to park their wealth in london and to keep the money in sterling was a strongly valued pound sterling.', 'in the s imports from the us threatened certain parts of the british domestic market for manufactured goods and the way out of the trade deficit was to devalue the currency.', 'but britain could not devalue or the empire surplus would leave its banking system..nazi germany also worked with a bloc of controlled countries by .', 'germany forced trading partners with a surplus to spend that surplus importing products from germany.', 'thus britain survived by keeping sterlingusing countries surpluses in its banking system and germany survived by forcing trading partners to purchase its own products.', 'the u.s. was concerned that a sudden dropoff in war spending might return its population to the unemployment levels of the s and so wanted sterlingusing countries and everyone in europe to be able to import from the us hence the u.s. supported free trade and international convertibility of currencies into gold or dollars..when many of the same experts who observed the s became the architects of a new unified postwar system at bretton woods their guiding principles became no more beggar thy neighbor and control flows of speculative financial capital.', 'preventing a repetition of this process of competitive devaluations was desired but in a way that would not force debtor countries to contract their industrial bases by keeping interest rates at a level high enough to attract foreign bank deposits.', 'john maynard keynes wary of repeating the great

these key s events look different to scholars of the era see the work of barry eichengreen golden fetters the gold standard and the great depression  and how to prevent a currency war in particular devaluations today are viewed with more nuance.', 'ben bernankes opinion on the subject follows.... he proximate cause of the world depression was a structurally flawed and poorly managed international gold standard.', '... for a variety of reasons including a desire of the federal reserve to curb the u.s. stock market boom monetary policy in several major countries turned contractionary in the late sa contraction that was transmitted worldwide by the gold standard.', 'what was initially a mild deflationary process began to snowball when the banking and currency crises of  instigated an international scramble for gold.', 'sterilization of gold inflows by surplus countries  substitution of gold for foreign exchange reserves and runs on commercial banks all led to increases in the gold backing of money and consequently to sharp unintended declines in national money supplies.', 'monetary contractions in turn were strongly associated with falling prices output and employment.', 'effective international cooperation could in principle have permitted a worldwide monetary expansion despite gold standard constraints but disputes over world war i reparations and war debts and the insularity and inexperience of the federal reserve among other factors prevented this outcome.', 'as a result individual countries were able to escape the deflationary vortex only by unilaterally abandoning the gold standard and reestablishing domestic monetary stability a process that dragged on in a halting and uncoordinated manner until france and the other gold bloc countries finally left gold in .', 'great depression b. bernanke.in  at bretton woods as a result of the collective conventional wisdom of the time representatives from all the leading allied states collectively favored a regulated system of fixed exchange rates indirectly disciplined by a us dollar tied to golda system that relied on a regulated market economy with tight controls on the values of currencies.', 'flows of speculative international finance were curtailed by shunting them through and limiting them via central banks.', 'this meant that international flows of investment went into foreign direct investment fdii.e.', 'construction of factories overseas rather than international currency manipulation or bond markets.', 'although the national experts disagreed to some degree on the specific implementation of this system all agreed on the need for tight controls..also based on experience of the interwar years u.s. planners developed a concept of economic securitythat a liberal international economic system would enhance the possibilities of postwar peace.', 'one of those who saw such a security link was cordell hull the united states secretary of state from  to .', 'hull believed that the fundamental causes of the two world wars lay in economic discrimination and trade warfare.', 'hull argued.nhampered trade dovetailed with peace high tariffs trade barriers and unfair economic competition with war  if we could get a freer flow of tradefreer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructionsso that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance of lasting peace..the developed countries also agreed that the liberal international economic system required governmental intervention.', 'in the aftermath of the great depression public management of the economy had emerged as a primary activity of governments in the developed states.', 'employment stability and growth were now important subjects of public policy..in turn the role of government in the national economy had become associated with the assumption by the state of the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic wellbeing.', 'the system of economic protection for atrisk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the great depression which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy and out of the theoretical contributions of the keynesian school of economics which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections..however increased government intervention in domestic economy brought with it isolationist sentiment that had a profoundly negative effect on international economics.', 'the priority of national goals independent national action in the interwar period and the failure to perceive that those national goals could not be realized without some form of international collaborationall resulted in beggarthyneighbor policies such as high tariffs competitive devaluations that contributed to the breakdown of the goldbased international monetary system domestic political instability and international war.', 'the lesson learned was as the principal architect of the bretton woods system new dealer harry dexter white put it.the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will  inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale..to ensure economic stability and political peace states agreed to cooperate to closely regulate the production of their currencies to maintain fixed exchange rates between countries with the aim of more easily facilitating international trade.', 'this was the foundation of the u.s. vision of postwar world free trade which also involved lowering tariffs and among other things maintaining a balance of trade via fixed exchange rates that would be favorable to the capitalist system..thus the more developed market economies agreed with the u.s. vision of postwar international economic management which intended to create and maintain an effective international monetary system and foster the reduction of barriers to trade and capital flows.', 'in a sense the new international monetary system was a return to a system similar to the prewar gold standard only using u.s. dollars as the worlds new reserve currency until international trade reallocated the worlds gold supply..thus the new system would be devoid initially of governments meddling with their currency supply as they had during the years of economic turmoil preceding wwii.', 'instead governments would closely police the production of their currencies and ensure that they would not artificially manipulate their price levels.', 'if anything bretton woods was a return to a time devoid of increased governmental intervention in economies and currency systems..the atlantic charter drafted during u.s. president franklin d. roosevelts august  meeting with british prime minister winston churchill on a ship in the north atlantic was the most notable precursor to the bretton woods conference.', 'like woodrow wilson before him whose fourteen points had outlined u.s. aims in the aftermath of the first world war roosevelt set forth a range of ambitious goals for the postwar world even before the u.s. had entered the second world war..the atlantic charter affirmed the right of all states to equal access to trade and raw materials.', 'moreover the charter called for freedom of the seas a principal u.s. foreign policy aim since france and britain had first threatened u.s. shipping in the s the disarmament of aggressors and the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security..as the war drew to a close the bretton woods conference was the culmination of some two and a half years of planning for postwar reconstruction by the treasuries of the u.s. and the uk.', 'u.s. representatives studied with their british counterparts the reconstitution of what had been lacking between the two world wars a system of international payments that would let countries trade without fear of sudden currency depreciation or wild exchange rate fluctuationsailments that had nearly paralyzed world capitalism during the great depression..without a strong european market for u.s. goods and services most policymakers believed the u.s. economy would be unable to sustain the prosperity it had achieved during the war.', 'in addition u.s. unions had only grudgingly accepted governmentimposed restraints on their demands during the war but they were willing to wait no longer particularly as inflation cut into the existing wage scales with painful force by the end of  there had already been major strikes in the automobile electrical and steel industries..in early  bernard baruch described the spirit of bretton woods as if we can stop subsidization of labor and sweated competition in the export markets as well as prevent rebuilding of war machines oh boy oh boy what long term prosperity we will have.', 'the united states could therefore use its position of influence to reopen and control the rules of the world economy so as to give unhindered access to all countries markets and materials..united states allieseconomically exhausted by the warneeded u.s. assistance to rebuild their domestic production and to finance their international trade indeed they needed it to survive..before the war the french and the british realized that they could no longer compete with u.s. industries in an open marketplace.', 'during the s the british created their own economic bloc to shut out u.s. goods.', 'churchill did not believe that he could surrender that protection after the war so he watered down the atlantic charters free access clause before agreeing to it..yet u.s. officials were determined to open their access to the british empire.', 'the combined value of british and u.s. trade was well over half of all the worlds trade in goods.', 'for the u.s. to open global markets it first had to split the british trade empire.', 'while britain had economically dominated the th century u.s. officials intended the second half of the th to be under u.s. hegemony..a senior official of the bank of england commented.one of the reasons bretton woods worked was that the u.s. was clearly the most powerful country at the table and so ultimately was able to impose its will on the others including an oftendismayed britain.', 'at the time one senior official at the bank of england described the deal reached at bretton woods as the greatest blow to britain next to the war largely because it underlined the way financial power had moved from the uk to the us..a devastated britain had little choice.', 'two world wars had destroyed the countrys principal industries that paid for the importation of half of the nations food and nearly all its raw materials except coal.', 'the british had no choice but to ask for aid.', 'not until the united states signed an agreement on  december  to grant britain aid of .', 'billion did the british parliament ratify the bretton woods agreements which occurred later in december ..free trade relied on the free convertibility of currencies.', 'negotiators at the bretton woods conference fresh from what they perceived as a disastrous experience with floating rates in the s concluded that major monetary fluctuations could stall the free flow of trade..the new economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment trade and payments.', 'unlike national economies however the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use.', 'in the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard but the architects of bretton woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy.', 'instead they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the u.s. dollar which was a gold standard currency for central banks as a reserve currency..in the th and early th centuries gold played a key role in international monetary transactions.', 'the gold standard was used to back currencies the international value of currency was determined by its fixed relationship to gold gold was used to settle international accounts.', 'the gold standard maintained fixed exchange rates that were seen as desirable because they reduced the risk when trading with other countries..imbalances in international trade were theoretically rectified automatically by the gold standard.', 'a country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply.', 'the resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports thus the deficit would be rectified.', 'any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend..this decrease in the amount of money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure.', 'supplementing the use of gold in this period was the british pound.', 'based on the dominant british economy the pound became a reserve transaction and intervention currency.', 'but the pound was not up to the challenge of serving as the primary world currency given the weakness of the british economy after the second world war..the architects of bretton woods had conceived of a system wherein exchange rate stability was a prime goal.', 'yet in an era of more activist economic policy governments did not seriously consider permanently fixed rates on the model of the classical gold standard of the th century.', 'gold production was not even sufficient to meet the demands of growing international trade and investment.', 'further a sizable share of the worlds known gold reserves was located in the soviet union which would later emerge as a cold war rival to the united states and western europe..the only currency strong enough to meet the rising demands for international currency transactions was the u.s. dollar.', 'the strength of the u.s. economy the fixed relationship of the dollar to gold  an ounce and the commitment of the u.s. government to convert dollars into gold at that price made the dollar as good as gold.', 'in fact the dollar was even better than gold it earned interest and it was more flexible than gold..the rules of bretton woods set forth in the articles of agreement of the international monetary fund imf and the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd provided for a system of fixed exchange rates.', 'the rules further sought to encourage an open system by committing members to the convertibility of their respective currencies into other currencies and to free trade..what emerged was the pegged rate currency regime.', 'members were required to establish a parity of their national currencies in terms of the reserve currency a peg and to maintain exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity a band by intervening in their foreign exchange markets that is buying or selling foreign money..in theory the reserve currency would be the bancor a world currency unit that was never implemented proposed by john maynard keynes however the united states objected and their request was granted making the reserve currency the u.s. dollar.', 'this meant that other countries would peg their currencies to the u.s. dollar andonce convertibility was restoredwould buy and sell u.s. dollars to keep market exchange rates within plus or minus  of parity.', 'thus the u.s. dollar took over the role that gold had played under the gold standard in the international financial system..meanwhile to bolster confidence in the dollar the u.s. agreed separately to link the dollar to gold at the rate of  per ounce.', 'at this rate foreign governments and central banks could exchange dollars for gold.', 'bretton woods established a system of payments based on the dollar which defined all currencies in relation to the dollar itself convertible into gold and above all as good as gold for trade.', 'u.s. currency was now effectively the world currency the standard to which every other currency was pegged..the u.s. dollar was the currency with the most purchasing power and it was the only currency that was backed by gold.', 'additionally all european states that had been involved in world war ii were highly in debt and transferred large amounts of gold into the united states a fact that contributed to the supremacy of the united states.', 'thus the u.s. dollar was strongly appreciated in the rest of the world and therefore became the key currency of the bretton woods system..member countries could only change their par value by more than  with imf approval which was contingent on imf determination that its balance of payments was in a fundamental disequilibrium.', 'the formal definition of fundamental disequilibrium was never determined leading to uncertainty of approvals and attempts to repeatedly devalue by less than  instead.', 'any country that changed without approval or after being denied approval was denied access to the imf..maintaining the fixed exchange system required countries to maintain sufficient foreign exchange reserves to intervene in markets and prevent fluctuations away from the pegged rate.', 'this also meant that international movement of capital could not be too large because that might lead to large fluctuations in the exchange rate and necessitate costly market interventions that risked depleting a countrys foreign exchange reserves..the bretton woods conference led to the establishment of the imf and the ibrd now the world bank which remain powerful forces in the world economy as of the s..a major point of common ground at the conference was the goal to avoid a recurrence of the closed markets and economic warfare that had characterized the s. thus negotiators at bretton woods also agreed that there was a need for an institutional forum for international cooperation on monetary matters.', 'already in  the british economist john maynard keynes emphasized the importance of rulebased regimes to stabilize business expectationssomething he accepted in the bretton woods system of fixed exchange rates.', 'currency troubles in the interwar years it was felt had been greatly exacerbated by the absence of any established procedure or machinery for intergovernmental consultation..as a result of the establishment of agreed upon structures and rules of international economic interaction conflict over economic issues was minimized and the significance of the economic aspect of international relations seemed to recede..officially established on  december  when the  participating countries at the conference of bretton woods signed its articles of agreement the imf was to be the keeper of the rules and the main instrument of public international management.', 'the fund commenced its financial operations on  march .', 'imf approval was necessary for any change in exchange rates in excess of .', 'it advised countries on policies affecting the monetary system and lent reserve currencies to countries that had incurred balance of payment debts..the big question at the bretton woods conference with respect to the institution that would emerge as the imf was the issue of future access to international liquidity and whether that source should be akin to a world central bank able to create new reserves at will or a more limited borrowing mechanism..although attended by  governments discussions at the conference were dominated by two rival plans developed by the united states and britain.', 'writing to the british treasury keynes who took the lead at the conference did not want many countries.', 'he believed that those from the colonies and semicolonies had nothing to contribute and will merely encumber the ground..as the chief international economist at the u.s. treasury in  harry dexter white drafted the u.s. blueprint for international access to liquidity which competed with the plan drafted for the british treasury by keynes.', 'overall whites scheme tended to favor incentives designed to create price stability within the worlds economies while keynes wanted a system that encouraged economic growth.', 'the collective agreement was an enormous international undertaking that took two years prior to the conference to prepare for.', 'it consisted of numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings to reach common ground on what policies would make up the bretton woods system..at the time gaps between the white and keynes plans seemed enormous.', 'white basically wanted a fund to reverse destabilizing flows of financial capital automatically.', 'white proposed a new monetary institution called the stabilization fund that would be funded with a finite pool of national currencies and gold that would effectively limit the supply of reserve credit.', 'keynes wanted incentives for the u.s. to help britain and the rest of europe rebuild after wwii.', 'outlining the difficulty of creating a system that every nation could accept in his speech at the closing plenary session of the bretton woods conference on  july  keynes stated.we the delegates of this conference mr president have been trying to accomplish something very difficult to accomplish.', 'it has been our task to find a common measure a common standard a common rule acceptable to each and not irksome to any..keynes proposals would have established a world reserve currency which he thought might be called bancor administered by a central bank vested with the power to create money and with the authority to take actions on a much larger scale..in the case of balance of payments imbalances keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies.', 'as outlined by keynes countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries build factories in debtor countries or donate to themand thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium.', 'thus keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much of the burden on the deficit country would be deflationary..but the united states as a likely creditor nation and eager to take on the role of the worlds economic powerhouse used whites plan but targeted many of keyness concerns.', 'white saw a role for global intervention in an imbalance only when it was caused by currency speculation..although a compromise was reached on some points because of the overwhelming economic and military power of the united states the participants at bretton woods largely agreed on whites plan.', 'whites plan was designed not merely to secure the rise and world economic domination of the united states but to ensure that as the outgoing superpower britain would be shuffled even further from centre stage..what emerged largely reflected u.s. preferences a system of subscriptions and quotas embedded in the imf which itself was to be no more than a fixed pool of national currencies and gold subscribed by each country as opposed to a world central bank capable of creating money.', 'the fund was charged with managing various countries trade deficits so that they would not produce currency devaluations that would trigger a decline in imports..the imf is provided with a fund composed of contributions from member countries in gold and their own currencies.', 'the original quotas were to total .', 'billion.', 'when joining the imf members are assigned quotas that reflect their relative economic powerand as a sort of credit deposit are obliged to pay a subscription of an amount commensurate with the quota.', 'they pay the subscription as  in gold or currency convertible into gold effectively the dollar which at the founding was the only currency then still directly gold convertible for central banks and  in their own currency..quota subscriptions form the largest source of money at the imfs disposal.', 'the imf set out to use this money to grant loans to member countries with financial difficulties.', 'each member is then entitled to withdraw  of its quota immediately in case of payment problems.', 'if this sum should be insufficient each nation in the system is also able to request loans for foreign currency..in the event of a deficit in the current account fund members when short of reserves would be able to borrow foreign currency in amounts determined by the size of its quota.', 'in other words the higher the countrys contribution was the higher the sum of money it could borrow from the imf..members were required to pay back debts within a period of  months to five years.', 'in turn the imf embarked on setting up rules and procedures to keep a country from going too deeply into debt year after year.', 'the fund would exercise surveillance over other economies for the u.s. treasury in return for its loans to prop up national currencies..imf loans were not comparable to loans issued by a conventional credit institution.', 'instead they were effectively a chance to purchase a foreign currency with gold or the members national currency..the u.s.backed imf plan sought to end restrictions on the transfer of goods and services from one country to another eliminate currency blocs and lift currency exchange controls..the imf was designed to advance credits to countries with balance of payments deficits.', 'shortrun balance of payment difficulties would be overcome by imf loans which would facilitate stable currency exchange rates.', 'this flexibility meant a member state would not have to induce a depression to cut its national income down to such a low level that its imports would finally fall within its means.', 'thus countries were to be spared the need to resort to the classical medicine of deflating themselves into drastic unemployment when faced with chronic balance of payments deficits.', 'before the second world war european governmentsparticularly britainoften resorted to this..the imf sought to provide for occasional discontinuous exchangerate adjustments changing a members par value by international agreement.', 'member states were permitted to adjust their currency exchange rate by .', 'this tended to restore equilibrium in their trade by expanding their exports and contracting imports.', 'this would be allowed only if there was a fundamental disequilibrium.', 'a decrease in the value of a countrys money was called a devaluation while an increase in the value of the countrys money was called a revaluation..it was envisioned that these changes in exchange rates would be quite rare.', 'however the concept of fundamental disequilibrium though key to the operation of the par value system was never defined in detail..never before had international monetary cooperation been attempted on a permanent institutional basis.', 'even more groundbreaking was the decision to allocate voting rights among governments not on a onestate onevote basis but rather in proportion to quotas.', 'since the united states was contributing the most u.s. leadership was the key.', 'under the system of weighted voting the united states exerted a preponderant influence on the imf.', 'the united states held onethird of all imf quotas at the outset enough on its own to veto all changes to the imf charter..in addition the imf was based in washington d.c. and staffed mainly by u.s. economists.', 'it regularly exchanged personnel with the u.s. treasury.', 'when the imf began operations in  president harry s. truman named white as its first u.s. executive director.', 'since no deputy managing director post had yet been created white served occasionally as acting managing director and generally played a highly influential role during the imfs first year.', 'truman had to abandon his original plan of naming white as imf executive director when fbi director j. edgar hoover submitted a report to the president asserting that white was a valuable adjunct to an underground soviet espionage organization who was placing individuals of high regard to soviet intelligence inside the government..the agreement made no provisions to create international reserves.', 'it assumed new gold production would be sufficient.', 'in the event of structural disequilibria it expected that there would be national solutions for example an adjustment in the value of the currency or an improvement by other means of a countrys competitive position.', 'the imf was left with few means however to encourage such national solutions..economists and other planners recognized in  that the new system could only commence after a return to normality following the disruption of world war ii.', 'it was expected that after a brief transition period of no more than five years the international economy would recover and the system would enter into operation..to promote growth of world trade and finance postwar reconstruction of europe the planners at bretton woods created another institution the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd which is one of five agencies that make up the world bank group and is perhaps now the most important agency of the group.', 'the ibrd had an authorized capitalization of  billion and was expected to make loans of its own funds to underwrite private loans and to issue securities to raise new funds to make possible a speedy postwar recovery.', 'the ibrd was to be a specialized agency of the united nations charged with making loans for economic development purposes..the bretton woods arrangements were largely adhered to and ratified by the participating governments.', 'it was expected that national monetary reserves supplemented with necessary imf credits would finance any temporary balance of payments disequilibria.', 'but this did not prove sufficient to get europe out of its conundrum..postwar world capitalism suffered from a dollar shortage.', 'the united states was running large balance of trade surpluses and u.s. reserves were immense and growing.', 'it was necessary to reverse this flow.', 'even though all countries wanted to buy u.s. exports dollars had to leave the united states and become available for international use so they could do so.', 'in other words the united states would have to reverse the imbalances in global wealth by running a balance of trade deficit financed by an outflow of u.s. reserves to other countries a u.s. financial account deficit.', 'the u.s. could run a financial deficit by either importing from building plants in or donating to foreign countries.', 'speculative investment was discouraged by the bretton woods agreement and importing from other locations was not appealing in the s because u.s. technology was cutting edge at the time.', 'so multinational corporations and global aid that originated from the u.s. burgeoned..the modest credit facilities of the imf were clearly insufficient to deal with western europes huge balance of payments deficits.', 'the problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the imf board of governors of the provision in the bretton woods articles of agreement that the imf could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes.', 'only the united states contribution of  million was actually available for ibrd lending.', 'in addition because the only available market for ibrd bonds was the conservative wall street banking market the ibrd was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy granting loans only when repayment was assured.', 'given these problems by  the imf and the ibrd themselves were admitting that they could not deal with the international monetary systems economic problems..the united states set up the european recovery program marshall plan to provide largescale financial and economic aid for rebuilding europe largely through grants rather than loans.', 'countries belonging to the soviet bloc e.g.', 'poland were invited to receive the grants but were given a favorable agreement with the soviet unions comecon.', 'in a speech at harvard university on  june  u.s. secretary of state george marshall stated.the breakdown of the business structure of europe during the war was complete.', 'europes requirements for the next three or four years of foreign food and other essential products  principally from the united states  are so much greater than her present ability to pay that she must have substantial help or face economic social and political deterioration of a very grave character..from  until  the u.s. deliberately encouraged an outflow of dollars and from  on the united states ran a balance of payments deficit with the intent of providing liquidity for the international economy.', 'dollars flowed out through various u.s. aid programs the truman doctrine entailing aid to the prou.s.', 'greek and turkish regimes which were struggling to suppress communist revolution aid to various prou.s.', 'regimes in the third world and most importantly the marshall plan.', 'from  to  the united states provided  western european countries with  billion in grants..to

decrease in gdp growth rates since the early s is due to increasing market saturation..marxian economics followers andrew kliman michael roberts and guglielmo carchedi in contradistinction to the monthly review school represented by foster pointed to capitalisms longterm tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally.', 'from this point of view the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone.', 'low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets where there was potential for greater return on investment.', 'the speculative frenzy of the late s and s was in this view a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital expressed through the fall in the rate of profit.', 'according to michael roberts the fall in the rate of profit eventually triggered the credit crunch of  when credit could no longer support profits..in  book the

computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval knowledge representation and computational linguistics a subfield of linguistics..major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition text classification natural language understanding and natural language generation..natural language processing has its roots in the s. already in  alan turing published an article titled computing machinery and intelligence which proposed what is now called the turing test as a criterion of intelligence though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence.', 'the proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language..the premise of symbolic nlp is wellsummarized by john searles chinese room experiment given a collection of rules e.g.', 'a chinese phrasebook with questions and matching answers the computer emulates natural language understanding or other nlp tasks by applying those rules to the data it confronts..up until the s most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of handwritten rules.', 'starting in the late s however there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.', 'this was due to both the steady increase in computational power see moores law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of chomskyan theories of linguistics e.g.', 'transformational grammar whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machinelearning approach to language processing..symbolic approach i.e.', 'the handcoding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols coupled with a dictionary lookup was historically the first approach used both by ai in general and by nlp in particular such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming..machine learning approaches which include both statistical and neural networks on the other hand have many advantages over the symbolic approach .rulebased systems are commonly used.in the late s and mids the statistical approach ended a period of ai winter which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rulebased approaches..the earliest decision trees producing systems of hard ifthen rules were still very similar to the old rulebased approaches.only the introduction of hidden markov models applied to partofspeech tagging announced the end of the old rulebased approach..a major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering.', 'since  the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach using semantic networks and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words.', '.intermediate tasks e.g.', 'partofspeech tagging and dependency parsing are not needed anymore.', '.neural machine translation based on thennewly invented sequencetosequence transformations made obsolete the intermediate steps such as word alignment previously necessary for statistical machine translation..the following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing.', 'some of these tasks have direct realworld applications while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks..though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined they can be subdivided into categories for convenience.', 'a coarse division is given below..based on longstanding trends in the field it is possible to extrapolate future directions of nlp.', 'as of  three trends among the topics of the longstanding series of conll shared tasks can be observed.most higherlevel nlp applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language.', 'more broadly speaking the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of nlp see trends among conll shared tasks above..cognition refers to the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought experience and the senses.', 'cognitive science is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes.', 'cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics.', 'especially during the age of symbolic nlp the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies..as an example george lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing nlp algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science along with the findings of cognitive linguistics with two defining aspects.ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of nlp but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the s. nevertheless approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks e.g.', 'of cognitive grammar functional grammar construction grammar computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience e.g.', 'actr however with limited uptake in mainstream nlp as measured by presence on major conferences of the acl.', 'more recently ideas of cognitive nlp have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability e.g.', 'under the notion of cognitive ai.',

because once something becomes useful enough and common enough its not labeled ai anymore..various subfields of ai research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.', 'the traditional goals of ai research include learning reasoning knowledge representation planning natural language processing perception and support for robotics.', 'to reach these goals ai researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques including search and mathematical optimization formal logic artificial neural networks and methods based on statistics operations research and economics.', 'ai also draws upon psychology linguistics philosophy neuroscience and other fields.', 'some companies such as openai google deepmind and meta aim to create artificial general

cycles of optimism throughout its history followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding known as ai winters.', 'funding and interest vastly increased after  when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous ai techniques.', 'this growth accelerated further after  with the transformer architecture.', 'in the s the period of rapid progress marked by advanced generative ai became known as the ai boom.', 'generative ai and its ability to create and modify content exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised ethical concerns about ais longterm effects and potential existential risks prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology..the general problem of simulating or creating intelligence has been broken into subproblems.', 'these consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display.', 'the traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of ai research..early researchers developed algorithms that imitated stepbystep reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.', 'by the late s and s methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information employing concepts from probability and economics..many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a combinatorial explosion they become exponentially slower as the problems grow.', 'even humans rarely use the stepbystep deduction that early ai research could model.', 'they solve most of their problems using fast intuitive judgments.', 'accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem..knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow ai programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about realworld facts.', 'formal knowledge representations are used in contentbased indexing and retrieval scene interpretation clinical decision support knowledge discovery mining interesting and actionable inferences from large databases and other areas..a knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program.', 'an ontology is the set of objects relations concepts and properties used by a particular domain of

knowledge what we know about what other people know default reasoning things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing and many other aspects and domains of knowledge..among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous and the subsymbolic form of most commonsense knowledge much of what people know is not represented as facts or statements that they could express verbally.', 'there is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition the problem of obtaining knowledge for ai applications..an agent is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world.', 'a rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.', 'in automated planning the agent has a specific goal.', 'in automated decisionmaking the agent has preferencesthere are some situations it would prefer to be in and some situations it is trying to avoid.', 'the decisionmaking agent assigns a number to each situation called the utility that measures how much the agent prefers it.', 'for each possible action it can calculate the expected utility the utility of all possible outcomes of the action weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur.', 'it can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility..in classical planning the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.', 'in most realworld problems however the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in it is unknown or unobservable and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action it is not deterministic.', 'it must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked..in some problems the agents preferences may be uncertain especially if there are other agents or humans involved.', 'these can be learned e.g.', 'with inverse reinforcement learning or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.', 'information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.', 'the space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be..a markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action.', 'a policy associates a decision with each possible state.', 'the policy could be calculated e.g.', 'by iteration be heuristic or

main varieties classification where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in and regression where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input..in reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones.', 'the agent learns to choose responses that are classified as good.', 'transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.', 'deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning..computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity by sample complexity how much data is required or by other notions of optimization..natural language processing nlp allows programs to read write and communicate in human languages such as english.', 'specific problems include speech recognition speech synthesis machine translation information extraction information retrieval and question answering..early work based on noam chomskys generative grammar and semantic networks had difficulty with wordsense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called microworlds due to the common sense knowledge problem.', 'margaret masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages and that

recognition image classification facial recognition object recognitionobject tracking and robotic perception..affective computing is a field that comprises systems that recognize interpret process or simulate human feeling emotion and mood.', 'for example some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction or to otherwise facilitate humancomputer interaction..however this tends to give nave users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.', 'moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and more recently multimodal sentiment analysis wherein ai classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject..a machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence..ai research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above..ai can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.', 'there are two very different kinds of search used in ai state space search and local search..state space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.', 'for example planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals attempting to find a path to a target goal a process called meansends analysis..simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most realworld problems the search space the number of places to search quickly grows to astronomical numbers.', 'the result is a search that is too slow or never completes.', 'heuristics or rules of thumb can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal..adversarial search is used for gameplaying programs such as chess or go.', 'it searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves looking for a winning position..local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem.', 'it begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally..gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function.', 'variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks through the backpropagation algorithm..another type of local search is evolutionary computation which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by mutating and recombining them selecting only the fittest to survive each generation..distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms.', 'two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization inspired by bird flocking and ant colony optimization inspired by ant trails..formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.formal logic comes in two main forms propositional logic which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as and or not and implies and predicate logic which also operates on objects predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as every x is a y and there are some xs that are ys..deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement conclusion from other statements that are given and assumed to be true the premises.', 'proofs can be structured as proof trees in which nodes are labelled by sentences and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules..given a problem and a set of premises problemsolving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms.', 'in the case of horn clauses problemsolving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.', 'in the more general case of the clausal form of firstorder logic resolution is a single axiomfree rule of inference in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved..inference in both horn clause logic and firstorder logic is undecidable and therefore intractable.', 'however backward reasoning with horn clauses which underpins computation in the logic programming language prolog is turing complete.', 'moreover its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages..fuzzy logic assigns a degree of truth between  and .', 'it can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true..nonmonotonic logics including logic programming with negation as failure are designed to handle default reasoning.', 'other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains..many problems in ai including reasoning planning learning perception and robotics require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information.', 'ai researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.', 'precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can
