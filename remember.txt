- Do a separate notebook that looks at the differences between TF-IDF vanilla implenetation and scikit by comparing the two using examples. Run into trouble with vanilla, solve with scikit.
- Have a section right after TF-IDf that explains we did not hop directly from frequency based algorithms but started with N-grams before moving to Neural network based algorithms.
- Reserach on when Neural networks imploded back and how they are now  the powerhouse of NLP
